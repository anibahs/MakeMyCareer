73, Prehospital care of acute stroke and patient selection for endovascular treatment using the RACE scale | Coursera,Course,https://www.coursera.org/learn/acute-stroke-race-scale,"Acute stroke is a time-dependent medical emergency. In acute ischemic stroke, the first objective is to restore brain flow using sistemic thrombolytic treatment and, in patients with large vessel occlusion, by endovascular treatment. In hemorrhagic stroke there are also specific treatments that can improve the clinical outcome.The sooner the initiation of all these therapies the higher the clinical benefit. Thus,  the organization of Stroke Code systems coordinated between emergency medical systems and hospitals is crucial to achieve early medical attention and treament.
Neurological scales facilitate stroke recognition at both hospital and pre-hospital levels and provide valuable information of stroke severity. The RACE scale is a prehospital scale validated as a tool to identify patients with suspected large vessel occlusion who are potential candidates for endovascular treatment. 

This course aims to update general knowledge in acute stroke and currently available treatments, to review the protocol
of the Stroke Code and, finally, to train in the use of the RACE scale.

The target profile of this course is aimed to all health professionals working in the field of emergencies.",,94 ratings,,"2,256 already enrolled"

105,"""Making"" Progress Teach-Out | Coursera",Course,https://www.coursera.org/learn/makingprogress,"What is âprogressâ? How do we decide when weâre moving forward and not taking steps backward? And how do we explore the idea of progress around public sites of memory? This Teach-Out is an invitation to think about what progress means, and how you can look for it wherever you areâin your city, community, or neighborhoodâand reflect upon your own ideas about the place you live in.Changes in the built environment of our communities are themselves the result of human actions and intentions, such as municipal planning, commercial enterprises, or communities transforming their own space. In other words, in our cities we can see the results of our plansâour attempts to create and shape the future. Neighbors, political groups, corporations, governments, schools, and other organizations, they all shape the community, leaving traces that allow us to see in what directions they transformed our lives. 

This Teach-Out will ask the following questions:
â¢	What are the forces that shape and change the places we inhabit? 
â¢	How do people connect with places in our modern cities? 
â¢	Do places progress? 
â¢	How can we measure in them whether there is any âprogressâ? 

We will interview a number of people who work in Atlanta, Georgia, but the questions and places we will see here are comparable to many of other places in the world on what it means to progress. In this Teach-Out you will learn how to find the history of public spaces in any community and how to reflect upon the idea of progress. Finally, you can join a conversation to discuss what has been explored, uncovered, and possibly transformed both within ourselves and our communities.

A Teach-Out is: 
â an event â it takes place over a fixed, short period of time 
â an opportunity â it is open for free participation to everyone around the world 
â a community â it will be joined by a large number of diverse individuals 
â a conversation â an opportunity to give and take ideas and information from people 

This community learning event invites participants from around the world to come together in conversation with the Emory campus community, including faculty experts. This Teach-Out is part of Emoryâs commitment to engage the local and global community in exploring and understanding problems, events, and phenomena most important to our society. 

Originating from University of Michigan (Teach-Out.org), Teach-Outs are short learning experiences focused on a specific current issue. Attendees will come together over a few days not only to learn about a subject or event but also to gain skills. Teach-Outs are open to the world and are designed to bring together individuals with wide-ranging perspectives in respectful and deep conversation. These events are an opportunity for diverse learners and a multitude of experts to come together to ask questions of one another and explore new solutions to the pressing concerns of our global community. Come, join the conversation!",,,,"2,074 already enrolled"
106,#talkmentalillness | Coursera,Course,https://www.coursera.org/learn/talkmentalillness,"I am a professor and mental health researcher and educator, and Iâve been working in the field for over 15 years. Like so many of my colleagues, however, I was unprepared for the wave of mental health challenges that would face our society in 2020. From COVID-19 and the devastating economic impacts of the pandemic to racial justice protests, widespread natural disasters, our current cultural moment presents unprecedented mental health concerns, and particularly for marginalized communities. For this reason, I led a field-wide call to action for mental health research and treatment that resulted in this #TalkMentalIllness course. I had the opportunity to speak to over 30 experts from different domains in psychology research, practice, and popular public figures and to discuss the causes and cutting-edge treatments for many serious disorders, the stigma surrounding mental illness in our culture, systemic inequality in mental health treatment, and the mental health challenges of today.#talkmentalillness curates the interviews from the Mental Health Experts series into an accessible learning experience that will help you have conversations about mental health. Talking about mental illness is both the content and desired outcome of this course, as you will use what you learn from my interviews with mental health experts to guide your own discussions about mental health challenges and treatments with family members, friends, colleagues, and other people in your life. The course will begin by presenting a core set of definitions for mental illness and analyzing the stigma associated with it. We will then apply these topics to specific psychological disorders, including anxiety and mood disorders, eating disorders, suicide, substance use, and psychosis. We will then consider how these issues disproportionately impact marginalized groups and communities of color. The course will conclude by considering innovative approaches to psychological treatments and how the pursuit and science of happiness inform mental health and wellness.
 
This course is part of a broader educational mission to share the science of mental illness with both students and the public, both locally and globally. I have designed and created it in collaboration with the Office for Academic Innovation and Librariesâ Media Services Team at the University of Colorado Boulder.

This course was first offered at Peking University in 2008 as a Public Elective Course, and subsequently as a Course for General Education. It is now being offered globally as one of Peking Universityâs MOOCs. 

Addressing students' interests in 20th century Western Music Culture and incorporating music theory, the course examines 20th century Western music. By combining theory and practice, the course not only aims to provide a clear view of the historical development of the music, but also emphasizes the training of aural skills and the accumulation of musical knowledge. The course covers not only classical music, such as neo-classical, expressionism, nationalism and other genres, but also explores in depth jazz, rock, and pop music of the 20th century. While studying Chinese music and other forms of national folk music in the 20th century world music context, students will also analyze large and complex works such as opera, musicals, and film music. By enhancing studentsâ understanding of 20th century Western music (classical music, pop music, folk music, comprehensive art) as a foundation, three core questions will be addressed: what is music, what is the 20th century Western music, and what is effective listening? The course aims to guide students to examine the three listening modes of 20th century Western music with the hope of forming a diverse and multi-faceted, knowledge and understanding of the 20th-century Western music culture phenomena, expanding studentsâ horizons, enhancing their ability to reason by analogy, and promoting cross-disciplinary, creative development.",,43 ratings,"2,162 recent views","4,093 already enrolled"
120,21st Century Energy Transition: how do we make it work? | Coursera,Course,https://www.coursera.org/learn/21st-century-energy-transition,"Affordable, abundant and reliable energy is fundamental to human well-being and prosperity. For the past 150 years, more and more people have gained access to energy, primarily in the form of fossil fuels â coal, petroleum and natural gas. But now, even while half of humanity cannot access adequate energy supplies, we are beginning a profound transition to more diverse energy sources. Climate change, environmental sustainability, and energy poverty are all important â and sometimes conflicting â drivers as we strive to supply more energy to more people with fewer negative impacts on Earthâs environments. In this course from the University of Alberta and Canadian Society for Evolving Energy, you will join us to learn about the many energy sources available, and where technology is providing exciting new solutions to energy and environmental challenges. Find out what roles energy storage must play to support the transition, and discuss how we can optimize transition processes. Examine competing viewpoints (ârealitiesâ) to enable energy transition, focusing on the practical challenges in bringing about change on a global basis. Finally, you will bring all these issues together to examine how the energy transition process is progressing and what we must do to create pathways to achieve our goals.",,14 ratings,"23,983 recent views",

154,3D Reconstruction - Multiple Viewpoints | Coursera,Course,https://www.coursera.org/learn/3d-reconstruction-multiple-viewpoints,"This course focuses on the recovery of the 3D structure of a scene from images taken from different viewpoints. We start by first building a comprehensive geometric model of a camera and then develop a method for finding (calibrating) the internal and external parameters of the camera model. Then, we show how two such calibrated cameras, whose relative positions and orientations are known, can be used to recover the 3D structure of the scene. This is what we refer to as simple binocular stereo. Next, we tackle the problem of uncalibrated stereo where the relative positions and orientations of the two cameras are unknown. Interestingly, just from the two images taken by the cameras, we can both determine the relative positions and orientations of the cameras and then use this information to estimate the 3D structure of the scene. Next, we focus on the problem of dynamic scenes. Given two images of a scene that includes moving objects, we show how the motion of each point in the image can be computed. This apparent motion of points in the image is called optical flow. Optical flow estimation allows us to track scene points over a video sequence. Next, we consider the video of a scene shot using a moving camera, where the motion of the camera is unknown. We present structure from motion that takes as input tracked features in such a video and determines not only the 3D structure of the scene but also how the camera moves with respect to the scene. The methods we develop in the course are widely used in object modeling, 3D site modeling, robotics, autonomous navigation, virtual reality and augmented reality.","['Epipolar Geometry', 'Camera Model', 'Camera Calibration', 'Structure from Motion', 'Simple Stereo']",15 ratings,"4,370 recent views","1,506 already enrolled"
155,3D Reconstruction - Single Viewpoint  | Coursera,Course,https://www.coursera.org/learn/3d-reconstruction---single-viewpoint,"This course focuses on the recovery of the 3D structure of a scene from its 2D images. In particular, we are interested in the 3D reconstruction of a rigid scene from images taken by a stationary camera (same viewpoint). This problem is interesting as we want the multiple images of the scene to capture complementary information despite the fact that the scene is rigid and the camera is fixed. To this end, we explore several ways of capturing images where each image provides additional information about the scene.In order to estimate scene properties (depth, surface orientation, material properties, etc.) we first define several important radiometric concepts, such as, light source intensity, surface illumination, surface brightness, image brightness and surface reflectance. Then, we tackle the challenging problem of shape from shading - recovering the shape of a surface from its shading in a single image. Next, we show that if multiple images of a scene of known reflectance are taken while changing the illumination direction, the surface normal at each scene point can be computed. This method, called photometric stereo, provides a dense surface normal map that can be integrated to obtain surface shape. 

Next, we discuss depth from defocus, which uses the limited depth of field of the camera to estimate scene structure. From a small number of images taken by changing the focus setting of the lens, a dense depth of the scene is recovered. Finally, we present a suite of techniques that use active illumination (the projection of light patterns onto the scene) to get precise 3D reconstructions of the scene. These active illumination methods are the workhorse of factory automation. They are used on manufacturing lines to assemble products and inspect their visual quality. They are also extensively used in other domains such as driverless cars, robotics, surveillance, medical imaging and special effects in movies.","['Photometric Stereo', 'Depth from Focus and Defocus', 'Structed Light Methods', 'Reflectance Models', 'Radiometry']",11 ratings,"4,439 recent views","1,685 already enrolled"

176,A Business Approach to Sustainable Landscape Restoration | Coursera,Course,https://www.coursera.org/learn/landscape-restoration-sustainable-development,"Integrated landscape management and large-scale landscape restoration should be in every companyâs business strategy because in order to reach the Sustainable Development Goal on Land Degradation Neutrality (SDG Number 15.3) scaling up and acceleration of business-driven landscape restoration is urgently needed.This requires business professionals with a vision, the right knowledge and skills. This MOOC aims to train the next generation of business professionals and developers to acknowledge businessâ interdependency with healthy landscapes and understand the value of ecosystem resources.

âHistorically, we have found countless ways to justify our continued exploitation of the environment: discovery, tradition, Manifest Destiny, even Chinese hoax. But weâre all out of excuses now. Each passing day swells the data on greenhouse gases and extreme weather, shrinking reservoirs and rising sea levels, and diminishing biodiversity. Our resources are finite, the window for change if not firmly shut, is certainly closing, and all life must adapt or be doomed.â

TÃ©a Obreht, 
The New Yorker, Dec. 19&26, 2016, p. 106.

It is a frightening prospect indeed â that all life on Earth must either adapt or be doomed. This course is about landscape degradation â a global and wicked problem that is contributing to the dooming prospect of depletion of Earthâs finite resources. But this course is also about the solutions to this problem â business driven landscape restoration.
So rather than leaving you powerless with the prospect Obreht puts fowards above, it is our hope that you learn how you can be part of the solution to making sure that Planet Earth still provides a safe and habitable home for future generations. 
We must act big and we must act now.
With this course we want to pass on valuable knowledge and teach you useful skills that you can apply in your professional life that will enable you to tackle the issue of landscape degradation and restoration. 
The issue is urgent, so letâs dive right into it.

This MOOC is developed by the ENABLE partnership, which is co-funded by the ERASMUS+ programme of the European Commission and involves a diverse, international group of organizations including Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University, Commonland, United Nations University Land Restoration Training Programme, the Spanish National Research Council and Estoril Global Conferences.",,67 ratings,"11,233 recent views","9,370 already enrolled"
177,A Circular Economy of Metals: Towards a Sustainable Societal Metabolism | Coursera,Course,https://www.coursera.org/learn/circular-economy-metals,"Metals are present everywhere around us and are one of the major materials upon which our economies are built. Economic development is deeply coupled with the use of metals. During the 20th century, the variety of metal applications in society grew rapidly. In addition to mass applications such as steel in buildings and aluminium in planes, more and more different metals are in use for innovative technologies such as the use of the speciality metal indium in LCD screens.  A lot of metals will be needed in the future. It will not be easy to provide them. In particular in emerging economies, but also in industrialised countries, the demand for metals is increasing rapidly. Mining and production activities expand, and with that also the environmental consequences of metal production.  

In this course, we will explore those consequences and we will also explore options to move towards a more sustainable system of metals production and use. We will focus especially on the options to reach a circular economy for metals: keeping metals in use for a very long time, to avoid having to mine new ones.  

This course is based on the reports of the Global Metals Flows Group of the International Resource Panel that is part of UN Environment.  An important aspect that will come back each week, are the UN Sustainable Development Goals, the SDGs. Those are ambitious goals to measure our progress towards a more sustainable world. We will use the SDGs as a touching stone for the assessment of the metals challenge, as well as the solutions we present in this course to solve that challenge.",,80 ratings,"13,844 recent views","5,697 already enrolled"
178,A Complete Reinforcement Learning System (Capstone) | Coursera,Course,https://www.coursera.org/learn/complete-reinforcement-learning-system,"In this final course, you will put together your knowledge from Courses 1, 2 and 3 to implement a complete RL solution to a problem. This capstone will let you see how each component---problem formulation, algorithm selection, parameter selection and representation design---fits together into a complete solution, and how to make appropriate choices when deploying RL in the real world. This project will require you to implement both the environment to stimulate your problem, and a control agent with Neural Network function approximation. In addition, you will conduct a scientific study of your learning system to develop your ability to assess the robustness of RL agents. To use RL in the real world, it is critical to (a) appropriately formalize the problem as an MDP, (b) select appropriate algorithms, (c ) identify what choices in your implementation will have large impacts on performance and (d) validate the expected behaviour of your algorithms.

185,A Journey through Western Christianity: from Persecuted Faith to Global Religion (200 - 1650)  | Coursera,Course,https://www.coursera.org/learn/western-christianity-200-1650,"This course follows the extraordinary development of Western Christianity from its early persecution under the Roman Empire in the third century to its global expansion with the Jesuits of the early modern world. We explore the dynamic and diverse character of a religion with an enormous cast characters. We will meet men and women who tell stories of faith as well as of violence, suppression, and division. Along the way, we encounter Perpetua and her martyrdom in Carthage; the struggles of Augustine the bishop in North Africa; the zeal of Celtic monks and missionaries; the viciousness of the Crusades; the visions of Brigit of Sweden; and the fracturing of Christianity by Martin Lutherâs protest. We hear the voices of great theologians as well as of those branded heretics by the Church, a powerful reminder that the growth of Christianity is a story with many narratives of competing visions of reform and ideals, powerful critiques of corruption and venality, and exclusion of the vanquished.  The troubled history of Christian engagement with Jews and Muslims is found in pogroms and expulsions, but also in the astonishing ways in which the culture of the West was transformed by Jewish and Islamic learning.We shall explore the stunning beauty of the Book of Kells, exquisitely prepared by monks as the Vikings terrorized the coast of England. We will experience the blue light of the windows of Chartres, and ponder the opening questions of Thomas Aquinasâ great Summa. We will read from the Gutenberg Bible of the fifteenth century, which heralded the revolution brought by the printing press. We will travel from Calvinâs Geneva to Elizabethâs England to Trent, where a Catholic Council met to inaugurate a modern, missionary Catholic church. We will walk through the great Escorial of Philip II of Spain, hear the poetry of John of the Cross, and follow the Jesuits to Brazil and China.
 
Christianity in the West was forged in the fires of conflict and tumult, and it brought forth both creativity and violence. It echoed with calls for Godâs world to be transformed, it inspired the most sublime art and architecture, yet it also revealed the power of the union of cross and sword to destroy. The course is a journey through the formation of the West as one strand of Christianity, as one chapter in a global story. It is a journey that has shaped our world.",,575 ratings,"31,309 recent views","34,225 already enrolled"

187,A Life of Happiness and Fulfillment | Coursera,Course,https://www.coursera.org/learn/happiness,"What are the determinants of a happy and fulfilling life?This is surely one of lifeâs biggest questions, and a question that has interested many of our ancestors. Buddha famously gave up his kingdom in search of happiness. Several Greek philosophers (from Aristotle to Epicurus and Plato to Socrates) had their own views on what it takes to be happy. And of course, we all have our own theories about happiness too.

How valid are our theories?

Until recently, if you wished for an answer to this question, you would've been forced to base it on discussions with spiritual leaders. Or, if you were lucky, you could've based it on late-night (and perhaps intoxicant-fueled) conversations with friends and family. Happily, all that has changed now. Over the past decade-and-a-half, scientists have gotten into the act big time. We now have a pretty good idea of what it takes to lead a happy and fulfilling life.

This course, based on the award-winning class offered both at the Indian School of Business and at the McCombs School of Business at The University of Texas at Austin, developed by Prof. Raj Raghunathan (aka ""Dr. Happy-smarts"") draws content from a variety of fields, including psychology, neuroscience, and behavioral decision theory to offer a tested and practical recipe for leading a life of happiness and fulfillment. 

Although not mandatory, reading Prof. Raj's forthcoming book, titled If you're so smart, why aren't you happy? can help you review and assimilate the material covered in this book at your leisure. 

For Coursera learners alone, the hardcover version of the book is available for a deep discount of 50%, plus shipping and handling. You can order the hardcover for 50% off by writing to Aaron at: Aaron@800ceoread.com. Please mention that you are a student of the ""coursera happiness course"" in your email. 

The course will feature guest appearances by several well-known thought leaders, including:
      - Dan Ariely (author of Predictably Irrational and, soon to be released, Irrationally Yours),
      - Ed Diener (âDr. Happinessâ),
      - Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (author of Flow),

By taking this course, you will discover the answers to questions such as:
      - Why arenât the smart-and-the-successful as happy as they couldâor shouldâbe
      - What are the â7 Deadly Happiness Sinsâ that even the smart and the successful commit?, and
      - What are the â7 Habits of the Highly Happyâ and how can you implement them in your life?

By the end of the course, I expect students who have been diligent with the lectures and exercises to not just gain a deeper understanding of the science of happiness, but to also be significantly happier.","['Gratitude', 'Mindfulness', 'Happiness', 'Meditation']","5,704 ratings","123,206 recent views","454,232 already enrolled"

205,A tecnologia da produÃ§Ã£o musical  | Coursera,Course,https://www.coursera.org/learn/tecnologia-producao-musical,"Aprenda sobre o processo de produÃ§Ã£o musical (inclusive sobre gravaÃ§Ã£o, ediÃ§Ã£o e mixagem) e conheÃ§a as ferramentas disponÃ­veis para criaÃ§Ã£o de mÃºsica contemporÃ¢nea no computador.Devido Ã  recente disponibilidade de softwares e hardwares de alta qualidade e baixo custo, agora as ferramentas de produÃ§Ã£o musical estÃ£o ao alcance de todos. Os Ã¡lbuns deixaram de ser criados apenas em estÃºdios, agora tambÃ©m sÃ£o criados em quartos. Ã primeira vista, isso Ã© libertador. Qualquer pessoa pode criar um Ã¡lbum por um custo bem baixo, basta comprar alguns equipamentos e um pacote de software. Mas, se vocÃª for mais a fundo, verÃ¡ que nÃ£o Ã© tÃ£o fÃ¡cil assim. Ã preciso conhecimento, dedicaÃ§Ã£o e criatividade para produzir mÃºsica.
    
Fornecer conhecimento Ã© o propÃ³sito deste curso. NÃ£o importa o tipo de mÃºsica que vocÃª estÃ¡ produzindo, hÃ¡ um grande conjunto de ferramentas que vocÃª precisarÃ¡ usar.  Cada liÃ§Ã£o deste curso demonstrarÃ¡ um conjunto diferente de ferramentas de produÃ§Ã£o musical, seguindo vagamente o processo da produÃ§Ã£o musical de gravar, editar e mixar. 

Vamos comeÃ§ar com algumas noÃ§Ãµes sobre a natureza do som e como o percebemos. Em seguida, vamos analisar os componentes necessÃ¡rios para gravar Ã¡udio em um computador, para que vocÃª compreenda os dispositivos pelos quais o som precisa se deslocar em um processo de produÃ§Ã£o musical. 
    
Depois de gravado, o som precisa ser organizado em uma linha de tempo, um processo conhecido como ediÃ§Ã£o. A ediÃ§Ã£o nos permite dar a impressÃ£o de execuÃ§Ãµes perfeitas e criar muitos dos sons que ouvimos na mÃºsica contemporÃ¢nea. A ferramenta de ediÃ§Ã£o contemporÃ¢nea Ã© a estaÃ§Ã£o de trabalho de Ã¡udio digital (DAW, Digital Audio Workstation), um software que armazena e organiza todos os recursos de um projeto musical. Vamos focar as ferramentas de ediÃ§Ã£o que sÃ£o essenciais na produÃ§Ã£o de mÃºsica contemporÃ¢nea e que sÃ£o fornecidas por todas as DAWs. 

ApÃ³s a ediÃ§Ã£o, os sons devem ser combinados ou mixados, por isso vamos analisar a mesa de mixagem, que pode ser um local muito criativo se vocÃª souber usÃ¡-la. Vamos explorar as funcionalidades bÃ¡sicas das mesas de mixagem em hardware e software, inclusive volume, panning, mudo, solo, barramentos, inserÃ§Ãµes, envios e submixagens. O processo de mixagem, no entanto, engloba mais ferramentas do que a mesa de mixagem fornece. O som tambÃ©m deve ser processado, ou seja, modificado de modo a fazer com que seu estado gravado se enquadre no contexto da mÃºsica. Vamos analisar a compressÃ£o, a equalizaÃ§Ã£o e o retardo, alÃ©m de examinar os muitos efeitos de Ã¡udio que sÃ£o extensÃµes desses dispositivos e como eles sÃ£o usados em um contexto musical.
    
No fim das contas, o processo de produÃ§Ã£o musical depende da sua criatividade. A criatividade Ã© um produto da mente, e ela permanece armazenada ali, sem ser expressada, atÃ© que as ferramentas certas sÃ£o usadas da maneira certa para compartilhÃ¡-la com o mundo. Se vocÃª tem uma ideia em mente, precisarÃ¡ passar por inÃºmeras etapas, cada uma com uma ferramenta importante, para chegar ao seu pÃºblico. Traga a dedicaÃ§Ã£o e criatividade para este curso, que ele fornecerÃ¡ o conhecimento para fazer acontecer.",,34 ratings,"4,007 recent views","3,115 already enrolled"

Rather than trying to define computational thinking, weâll just say itâs a problem-solving process that includes lots of different components. Most people have a better understanding of what beginning C programming means!This course assumes you have the prerequisite knowledge from the previous two courses in the specialization. You should make sure you have that knowledge, either by taking those previous courses or from personal experience, before tackling this course. The required prerequisite knowledge is listed below. 

Prerequisite computational thinking knowledge: Algorithms and procedures and data collection, analysis, and representation
Prerequisite C knowledge: Data types, variables, constants; STEM computations; selection; and iteration (looping)

Throughout this course the computational thinking topics you'll explore are abstraction, which is deciding which details matter for the problem you're trying to solve, and problem decomposition, which is about breaking large problems into smaller sub-problems to handle complexity. For the programming topics, you'll continue building on your C knowledge by practicing using arrays, which let you store multiple values in a single variable, and strings, which are arrays of characters. You'll also learn how to implement functions, which are the mechanism we use for problem decomposition in our C programs.

Module 1: Learn about arrays as a way to store multiple values in a single variable
Module 2: Discover how we store and process strings (arrays of characters)

Sports and political change walk hand in hand in America. The way that athletes and institutions deal with questions of race, economic hardship, nationalism, and political ties have become central to the way that we understand ourselves and our society. And yet, there are those who would prefer their sports free of controversy and opinion. Dedicated athletes, coaches, and media personalities have pushed back against this refrain, demanding to be seen not just as entertainers but as fully formed humans with political opinions and experiences. Their struggles against injustice have changed the face of America and kicked off a reckoning within modern-day sports. How does context inform the shape and outcome of protests? What is it about sports that provides space â or doesn't â for political statements? Why do some of us expect athletes to be activists, when others would rather they ""shut up and dribble""? We'll explore all of these questions and more in this class. 

Your professor will be NBA All-Star and TNT Sports journalist and commentator Chris Webber, who leads interviews with iconic activists, including John Carlos and Jemele Hill as they wrestle with the meanings and outcomes of their activism. You'll read and watch primary source documents about acts of protest, and academic and journalistic work that reckons with the legacies of those acts. By the end of the course, you'll have a better understanding of historical and contemporary protest moments, and be able to create and apply new ways of thinking about the activism within the world of sports in history and today.",,11 ratings,"2,294 recent views",

This course examines these tensions and how transformational, authentic and inclusive leadership styles offer an alternative to the more autocratic, job-centred and controlling leadership styles of the past. Youâll learn how the digital revolution, along with an increased focus on projects and teamwork, has dramatically altered the perception of leadership in a way that now demands all organisational members take on some form of self-leadership. And youâll learn how this change is causing tensions between traditional leaders and the contemporary practices vital to maintain agility in todayâs ultra-competitive marketplace. This learning will be complemented by structured activities such as video lectures, quizzes, discussion prompts and written assessments.","['Communication', 'Staff Management', 'Leadership Development']",725 ratings,"90,446 recent views","26,939 already enrolled"

Adaptability is what allows people and businesses to solve problems, overcome challenges and move back from the edge of attrition to the more stable ground of relevance. Adaptability is everything. â Jeff Boss, ForbesAdaptability refers to your ability change your actions, course, or approach in order to suit different conditions or environments. Adaptability implies a sense of personal choice, of purposefully navigatingârather than being driven byâchanging circumstances. 

Resilience is the capacity to recover quickly from difficulties. Resilience gives you the ability to bounce forward with new insights and learning you can carry into the future. 

Both adaptability and resilience include the ability to assess an evolving situation from multiple perspectives, to shift thinking and viewpoint, and to choose the best response. Adaptable people flourish amidst chaos while inflexible people flounder. Adapters find openings in situations where others only see closure. This 4-module course will give you knowledge and tools to become more adaptable and resilient in your workplace and in your life.","['Personal Advertisement', 'Planning', 'Adaptability', 'Resilience']",201 ratings,"43,851 recent views","7,270 already enrolled"

We then proceed to linear programming with applications in optimizing budget allocation, portfolio optimization, finding the cheapest diet satisfying all requirements and many others. Next we discuss inherently hard problems for which no exact good solutions are known (and not likely to be found) and how to solve them in practice. We finish with a soft introduction to streaming algorithms that are heavily used in Big Data processing. Such algorithms are usually designed to be able to process huge datasets without being able even to store a dataset.","['Python Programming', 'Linear Programming (LP)', 'Np-Completeness', 'Dynamic Programming']",650 ratings,"53,633 recent views","73,363 already enrolled"

You will go through all typical steps of a data analytics project, including data understanding and cleanup, data analysis, and presentation of analytical results. 
For the first week, the goal is to understand the data and prepare the data for analysis. As we discussed  in this specialization, data preprocessing and cleanup is often the first step in data analytics projects. Needless to say, this step is crucial for the success of this project.  

In the second week, you will perform some predictive analytics tasks, including classifying loans and predicting losses from defaulted loans. You will try a variety of tools and techniques  this week, as the predictive accuracy of different tools can vary quite a bit. It is rarely the case that the default model produced by ASP is the best model possible. Therefore, it is important for you to tune the different models in order to improve the performance.

Beginning in the third week, we turn our attention to prescriptive analytics, where you will provide some concrete suggestions on how to allocate investment funds using analytics tools, including clustering and simulation based optimization. You will see that allocating funds wisely is crucial for the financial return of the investment portfolio.

In the last week, you are expected to present your analytics results to your clients.

It assumes you have completed the prior courses on ""Attitude Control with Momentum Exchange Devices"" and ""Analytical Mechanics for Spacecraft Dynamics"".  This project course investigates the dynamics of a complex spacecraft system where there is a rigid hub onto which a hinged panel is attached.  This simulates a spacecraft with a time varying geometry.First, the three-dimensional kinematics of this system are explored.  Analytical relationships of the body and panel position and velocity states are derived, and the center of mass properties of this system are explored.

Next, a simplified system is used to use Lagrange's equations of motion to predict the dynamical response.  With these differential equations we are then able to apply attitude control torques and investigate the rotational response if the spacecraft hub has a spring-hinged panel attached.  Two open-loop control torque solutions are investigated.  The classical minimum time bang-bang control solution is applied first, illustrating how such a control can yield unwanted panel oscillations.  Finally, a filtered version of the bang-bang control is applied to illustrated how the panel oscillations can be significantly reduced at the cost of a slightly longer nominal maneuver time.","['input shaped attitude control', 'time varying geometry', 'spacecraft simulation', 'center of mass properties']",,,

It uses hands-on exercises to demonstrate in practical terms how to get acquainted with these tools but is by no means meant to be a comprehensive dive into these tools.  The course introduces tools and their concepts such as git and GitHub, code review, Docker, and GitHub actions.Target Audience  

The course is intended for students in the biomedical sciences and researchers who use informatics tools in their research. It is the follow up course to the Introduction to Reproducibility in Cancer Informatics course. Learners who take this course should: 

- Have some familiarity with R or Python
- Have take the Introductory Reproducibility in Cancer Informatics course
- Have some familiarity with GitHub

Motivation

Data analyses are generally not reproducible without direct contact with the original researchers and a substantial amount of time and effort (BeaulieuJones, 2017). Reproducibility in cancer informatics (as with other fields) is still not monitored or incentivized despite that it is fundamental to the scientific method. Despite the lack of incentive, many researchers strive for reproducibility in their own work but often lack the skills or training to do so effectively.

Equipping researchers with the skills to create reproducible data analyses increases the efficiency of everyone involved. Reproducible analyses are more likely to be understood, applied, and replicated by others. This helps expedite the scientific process by helping researchers avoid false positive dead ends. Open source clarity in reproducible methods also saves researchers' time so they don't have to reinvent the proverbial wheel for methods that everyone in the field is already performing.

Curriculum  

The course includes hands-on exercises for how to apply reproducible code concepts to their code. Individuals who take this course are encouraged to complete these activities as they follow along with the course material to help increase the reproducibility of their analyses.

**Goal of this course:**  
To equip learners with a deeper knowledge of the capabilities of reproducibility tools and how they can apply to their existing analyses scripts and projects.

411,"Advanced Valuation and Strategy - M&A, Private Equity, and Venture Capital | Coursera",Course,https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-valuation-and-strategy,"Hi and welcome to this course! Would you like to learn about the latest valuation methods that may help you to make better business decisions? Then 'Advanced Valuation and Strategy â M&A, Private Equity, and Venture Capital' by Erasmus University Rotterdam is the right course for you! This course is helpful for executives that need to value complete strategies and for all students interested in corporate finance and strategy. We present the latest tools and show you how to apply them!

We will revolutionize your way of decision making, by extending static techniques from corporate finance with dynamic methods to quantify strategic thinking. Traditionally, we assess the attractiveness of an investment as a mature business, where future cash flows mainly result from past decisions. But, in an ever-changing world, strategic decisions determine the firmâs long-term success and market value. Yet managers often have to consider these long-term implications using intuition and experience alone, with little guidance from structured, quantitative analysis.

Our treatment goes far beyond the use of standard valuation analysis. We introduce the expanded NPV, which brings together DCF, real options, and game theory. Thinking in terms of options, games, and adaptive strategies may help managers address strategic questions such as: How do you value a leveraged buyout? How can you value a high-tech venture with negative cash flows? When should you invest in new ventures in stages? How can you incorporate rival bidders in the analysis?

The tools we provide can improve your decisions in business and in daily life.

* Who is this class for?
We hope that our course appeals to (graduate) students in finance, economics, and business, as well as to high-ranking professionals and a general audience.

The rebellions promised the return of politics and the reassertion of popular sovereignty against their corrupt and geriatric leaders. Much hope and flowery language greeted the young men and women who deposed their leaders and tried to build new, better societies.

Today, the Arab world is in deep crisis. Of the 22 member states of the Arab League, at least five have essentially collapsed: Iraq, Libya, Yemen, Somalia and Syria exist only in name today, as their territories have fallen to competing, murderous armed groups. In the remaining countries, the old autocracies have reasserted themselves. The repression at home is now worsened by regional conflict on an unprecedented scale, and the resulting frustration has led to the biggest refugee flows in recent memory. What went wrong?

This course offers an overview of the structural shortcomings of Arab states and societies, which help us understand why the democratic awakening did not happen but instead âhas given way to civil wars, ethnic, sectarian and regional divisions and the reassertion of absolutism.â This raises the obvious and renewed question whether there is something inherent in the Arab, and by analogy Muslim, condition that makes them special. Does this condition make this part of the world impervious to generally observable trends towards greater accountability, popular participation in political decision-making, greater generation and fairer division of economic wealth?

If youâd like to explore how we can interact with the world in a rigorous, computational way, and would also like to start learning to program, this is the course for you!You may have heard lots of talk about computational thinking recently, but if you ask 10 different people what it is youâll probably get 10 different answers. Rather than trying to define computational thinking, weâll just say itâs a problem-solving process that includes lots of different components. In this course, weâll explore algorithms and data collection.

Most people have a better understanding of what beginning C programming means! Youâll start learning how to develop C programs in this course by writing your first C program; learning about data types, variables, and constants; and honing your C programming skills by implementing a variety of STEM computations. This course doesn't assume you have any previous programming experience, so don't worry if you've never written code before.

If that all sounds interesting to you, go ahead and jump into the course!

Caution: Beginning (assuming no prior programming knowledge) is not the same as easy (not hard to do). Learning to program IS hard to do, especially since the courses in this specialization are built from a freshman-level college course. Meeting the course challenges while you master the material will be rewarding to you, but doing that will require hard work and maybe even a few expletives along the way.

Module 1: Learn about algorithms and write your first C program
Module 2: Discover how we store data in our programs
Module 3: Explore how we use data collection to solve problems and answer questions
Module 4: Practice writing C programs to implement STEM computations",,338 ratings,"9,753 recent views","19,146 already enrolled"

Next Kane's equations and the virtual power form of D'Alembert's equations are briefly reviewed for particles.Next Lagrangeâs equations are developed which still assume a finite set of generalized coordinates, but can be applied to multiple rigid bodies as well.  Lagrange multipliers are employed to apply Pfaffian constraints.  

Finally, Hamiltonâs extended principle is developed to allow us to consider a dynamical system with flexible components.  Here there are an infinite number of degrees of freedom.  The course focuses on how to develop spacecraft related partial differential equations, but does not study numerically solving them.  The course ends comparing the presented assumed mode methods to classical final element solutions.","['Lagrangian Dynamics', 'holonomic constraints', ""D'Alembert's Principle"", ""Hamilton's Extended Principle"", 'multi-body dynamics']",,"3,662 recent views",

572,"Anatomy of the Chest, Neck, Abdomen, and Pelvis | Coursera",Course,https://www.coursera.org/learn/trunk-anatomy,"WARNING: THESE VIDEOS CONTAIN IMAGES OF HUMAN DISSECTION. MAY BE DISTURBING TO SOME.Human structure is important to all of us as it has been for millennia.  Artists, teachers, health care providers, scientists and most children try to understand the human form from stick figure drawings to electron microscopy. Learning the form of people is of great interest to us â physicians, nurses, physician assistants, emergency medical services personnel and many, many others.

Learning anatomy classically involved dissection of the deceased whether directly in the laboratory or from texts, drawings, photographs or videos.  There are many wonderful resources for the study of anatomy.  Developing an understanding of the human form requires significant work and a wide range of resources.

In this course, we have attempted to present succinct videos of human anatomy.  Some will find these images to be disturbing and these images carry a need to respect the individual who decided to donate their remains to benefit our teaching and learning.

All of the dissections depicted in the following videos are from individuals who gave their remains to be used in the advancement of medical education and research after death to the Yale School of Medicine.

The sequence of videos is divided into classic anatomic sections.  Each video has a set of learning objectives and a brief quiz at the end.  Following each section there is another quiz covering the entire section in order for you to test your knowledge.  

We hope these videos will help you better understand the human form, make time that you may have in the laboratory more worthwhile if you have that opportunity and help you develop an appreciation of the wonderful intricacies of people.

Modules 2 and 3 investigate human-animal relationships, including those that involve suffering as well as those that are beneficial. Although many people describe their pets as friends or family members, Module 2 takes a deeper dive into what constitutes friendship and family membership where other species are concerned. Module 3 examines the dark side of these relationships, focusing on animal abuse and its relationship to domestic violence. Module 4 focuses on peopleâs encounters with those animals outside the boundaries of the home and the farm. The way people understand and regard the species commonly considered âwildâ shapes the treatment and moral status of these animals.","['Animal welfare', 'Sociological concepts']",88 ratings,"6,871 recent views","3,959 already enrolled"

- Use and comprehend contemporary intersectional terminology through a provided glossary
- Critically discuss âwhitenessâ
- Recognize the concept of White privilege that all White people have whether they want that privilege or not and to differentiate between White supremacy as a systemic concept vs. White supremacists (who are professional racists like the KKK).
- Distinguish between being not racist and being anti-racist
- Define systemic and institutional racism 
- Accept the unequal history of race and racism in the United States that has created racial hierarchies that has disenfranchised Black Americans
- Share with others the true foundations of United Statesâs histories beginning with the acknowledgement of settler colonialism and the rewards that White people have received due to White supremacy and Black oppression.
- Talk about race and racism
- Explain why phrases like âAll Lives Matterâ and âBlue Lives Matterâ are racist
- Recognize that anyone can be anti-racist--it only takes the dedication and decision to be anti-racist, to educate yourself about the history of racism in the US and then to talk in an anti-racist way and to act as an anti-racist

Anti-Racism II is for anyone who has previously taken Anti-Racism I, or who has basic knowledge of the racial issues plaguing the United States, and globally.Anti-Racism I focused upon how to have open dialogue and conversations about race and racism. Anti-Racism II takes on the vital role assisting students in guiding their own conversations regarding race, and additionally gender and sexuality. Anti-Racism II will expand your knowledge and critically engage your inquiry, centering upon short interviews with leading scholars and activists in the field.   Coupled with supplementary video and reading material, these interviews will further demonstrate the power of open dialogue and self-narration, directing you towards being an anti-racist ally. The centrality of the course interviews will culminate in a final project where students will construct and carry out their own personalized interview. The final project will test dialogic skills while asserting the importance of intimate conversations about race, gender, and sexuality. 

This is challenging work in troubling times that may conjure uneasy feelings and emotions. Anti-Racism II can work as a bridge coming face to face with your personal individual relationship with social demands plaguing us nationally and globally. The remedy is to allow yourself uncomfortableness in order to get to the solutions. We are all in this together.

Course Description
Antibiotics are among the most frequently prescribed classes of drugs and it is estimated that approximately 50% of antibiotic use, in both the outpatient and inpatient settings, is inappropriate. At the same time, in contrast to any other class of drugs, every antibiotic use has a potential public health consequence â inappropriate use may not harm only the individual patient, but contributes to societal harm by exerting an unnecessary selective pressure that may lead to antibiotic resistance among bacteria. This video based course will introduce learners to the basic principles of appropriate antibiotic use, demonstrate how to apply these principles to the management of common infections, and outline how to develop and maintain an antimicrobial stewardship program. We will offer a number of illustrative cases, recognizable to the practicing physician in his or her practice to engage learners in the thought processes that lead to optimal decision making, improved outcomes of individual patients, and harm reduction vis-a-vis the bacterial ecology. The course will also explore strategies to implement principles of antimicrobial stewardship both in your practice and also at a program level.",,303 ratings,"35,126 recent views","37,743 already enrolled"

679, Know Thyself - The Value and Limits of Self-Knowledge: The Examined Life | Coursera,Course,https://www.coursera.org/learn/know-thyself-the-examined-life,"According to legend, inscribed on walls of the temple on the sacred site of Delphi in Ancient Greece were two premier injunctions: NOTHING IN EXCESS, and KNOW THYSELF. This course will be an examination of the latter injunction in an effort to discover what self-knowledge is, why it might be valuable, and what, if any, limitations it might face. What is missing from a person lacking in self-knowledge that makes her less wise, virtuous, or competent in certain areas than others who have this capacity, and what if anything might she do to fill that gap?  Historical sources as well as recent research in philosophy, experimental social psychology, and neuroscience will inform our investigation, in the course of which we will become students of our own dreams, and cultivate some meditative practices.Learning Outcomes: 
Learners will gain familiarity with prominent themes from Western, classical Chinese, and Buddhist approaches to our knowledge of ourselves. In the course of doing so, they will gain an appreciation of the relation of self-knowledge to wisdom, of the value of intellectual humility, as well as of methods of learning about oneself that do not depend on introspection. 

Learners will also become familiar with contemporary research in experimental social psychology, philosophy, and neuroscience into the emotions, the unconscious, the role of affect in decision making, and self-deception. They will also gain an appreciation of a challenge to the assumption of a coherent, unified self that derives from the Buddhist tradition.

735,"""Making"" Progress Teach-Out | Coursera",Course,https://www.coursera.org/learn/makingprogress,"What is âprogressâ? How do we decide when weâre moving forward and not taking steps backward? And how do we explore the idea of progress around public sites of memory? This Teach-Out is an invitation to think about what progress means, and how you can look for it wherever you areâin your city, community, or neighborhoodâand reflect upon your own ideas about the place you live in.Changes in the built environment of our communities are themselves the result of human actions and intentions, such as municipal planning, commercial enterprises, or communities transforming their own space. In other words, in our cities we can see the results of our plansâour attempts to create and shape the future. Neighbors, political groups, corporations, governments, schools, and other organizations, they all shape the community, leaving traces that allow us to see in what directions they transformed our lives. 

This Teach-Out will ask the following questions:
â¢	What are the forces that shape and change the places we inhabit? 
â¢	How do people connect with places in our modern cities? 
â¢	Do places progress? 
â¢	How can we measure in them whether there is any âprogressâ? 

We will interview a number of people who work in Atlanta, Georgia, but the questions and places we will see here are comparable to many of other places in the world on what it means to progress. In this Teach-Out you will learn how to find the history of public spaces in any community and how to reflect upon the idea of progress. Finally, you can join a conversation to discuss what has been explored, uncovered, and possibly transformed both within ourselves and our communities.

A Teach-Out is: 
â an event â it takes place over a fixed, short period of time 
â an opportunity â it is open for free participation to everyone around the world 
â a community â it will be joined by a large number of diverse individuals 
â a conversation â an opportunity to give and take ideas and information from people 

This community learning event invites participants from around the world to come together in conversation with the Emory campus community, including faculty experts. This Teach-Out is part of Emoryâs commitment to engage the local and global community in exploring and understanding problems, events, and phenomena most important to our society. 

Originating from University of Michigan (Teach-Out.org), Teach-Outs are short learning experiences focused on a specific current issue. Attendees will come together over a few days not only to learn about a subject or event but also to gain skills. Teach-Outs are open to the world and are designed to bring together individuals with wide-ranging perspectives in respectful and deep conversation. These events are an opportunity for diverse learners and a multitude of experts to come together to ask questions of one another and explore new solutions to the pressing concerns of our global community. Come, join the conversation!",,,,"2,074 already enrolled"
736,#talkmentalillness | Coursera,Course,https://www.coursera.org/learn/talkmentalillness,"I am a professor and mental health researcher and educator, and Iâve been working in the field for over 15 years. Like so many of my colleagues, however, I was unprepared for the wave of mental health challenges that would face our society in 2020. From COVID-19 and the devastating economic impacts of the pandemic to racial justice protests, widespread natural disasters, our current cultural moment presents unprecedented mental health concerns, and particularly for marginalized communities. For this reason, I led a field-wide call to action for mental health research and treatment that resulted in this #TalkMentalIllness course. I had the opportunity to speak to over 30 experts from different domains in psychology research, practice, and popular public figures and to discuss the causes and cutting-edge treatments for many serious disorders, the stigma surrounding mental illness in our culture, systemic inequality in mental health treatment, and the mental health challenges of today.#talkmentalillness curates the interviews from the Mental Health Experts series into an accessible learning experience that will help you have conversations about mental health. Talking about mental illness is both the content and desired outcome of this course, as you will use what you learn from my interviews with mental health experts to guide your own discussions about mental health challenges and treatments with family members, friends, colleagues, and other people in your life. The course will begin by presenting a core set of definitions for mental illness and analyzing the stigma associated with it. We will then apply these topics to specific psychological disorders, including anxiety and mood disorders, eating disorders, suicide, substance use, and psychosis. We will then consider how these issues disproportionately impact marginalized groups and communities of color. The course will conclude by considering innovative approaches to psychological treatments and how the pursuit and science of happiness inform mental health and wellness.
 
This course is part of a broader educational mission to share the science of mental illness with both students and the public, both locally and globally. I have designed and created it in collaboration with the Office for Academic Innovation and Librariesâ Media Services Team at the University of Colorado Boulder.

This course was first offered at Peking University in 2008 as a Public Elective Course, and subsequently as a Course for General Education. It is now being offered globally as one of Peking Universityâs MOOCs. 

Addressing students' interests in 20th century Western Music Culture and incorporating music theory, the course examines 20th century Western music. By combining theory and practice, the course not only aims to provide a clear view of the historical development of the music, but also emphasizes the training of aural skills and the accumulation of musical knowledge. The course covers not only classical music, such as neo-classical, expressionism, nationalism and other genres, but also explores in depth jazz, rock, and pop music of the 20th century. While studying Chinese music and other forms of national folk music in the 20th century world music context, students will also analyze large and complex works such as opera, musicals, and film music. By enhancing studentsâ understanding of 20th century Western music (classical music, pop music, folk music, comprehensive art) as a foundation, three core questions will be addressed: what is music, what is the 20th century Western music, and what is effective listening? The course aims to guide students to examine the three listening modes of 20th century Western music with the hope of forming a diverse and multi-faceted, knowledge and understanding of the 20th-century Western music culture phenomena, expanding studentsâ horizons, enhancing their ability to reason by analogy, and promoting cross-disciplinary, creative development.",,43 ratings,"2,162 recent views","4,093 already enrolled"
750,21st Century Energy Transition: how do we make it work? | Coursera,Course,https://www.coursera.org/learn/21st-century-energy-transition,"Affordable, abundant and reliable energy is fundamental to human well-being and prosperity. For the past 150 years, more and more people have gained access to energy, primarily in the form of fossil fuels â coal, petroleum and natural gas. But now, even while half of humanity cannot access adequate energy supplies, we are beginning a profound transition to more diverse energy sources. Climate change, environmental sustainability, and energy poverty are all important â and sometimes conflicting â drivers as we strive to supply more energy to more people with fewer negative impacts on Earthâs environments. In this course from the University of Alberta and Canadian Society for Evolving Energy, you will join us to learn about the many energy sources available, and where technology is providing exciting new solutions to energy and environmental challenges. Find out what roles energy storage must play to support the transition, and discuss how we can optimize transition processes. Examine competing viewpoints (ârealitiesâ) to enable energy transition, focusing on the practical challenges in bringing about change on a global basis. Finally, you will bring all these issues together to examine how the energy transition process is progressing and what we must do to create pathways to achieve our goals.",,14 ratings,"23,983 recent views",

784,3D Reconstruction - Multiple Viewpoints | Coursera,Course,https://www.coursera.org/learn/3d-reconstruction-multiple-viewpoints,"This course focuses on the recovery of the 3D structure of a scene from images taken from different viewpoints. We start by first building a comprehensive geometric model of a camera and then develop a method for finding (calibrating) the internal and external parameters of the camera model. Then, we show how two such calibrated cameras, whose relative positions and orientations are known, can be used to recover the 3D structure of the scene. This is what we refer to as simple binocular stereo. Next, we tackle the problem of uncalibrated stereo where the relative positions and orientations of the two cameras are unknown. Interestingly, just from the two images taken by the cameras, we can both determine the relative positions and orientations of the cameras and then use this information to estimate the 3D structure of the scene. Next, we focus on the problem of dynamic scenes. Given two images of a scene that includes moving objects, we show how the motion of each point in the image can be computed. This apparent motion of points in the image is called optical flow. Optical flow estimation allows us to track scene points over a video sequence. Next, we consider the video of a scene shot using a moving camera, where the motion of the camera is unknown. We present structure from motion that takes as input tracked features in such a video and determines not only the 3D structure of the scene but also how the camera moves with respect to the scene. The methods we develop in the course are widely used in object modeling, 3D site modeling, robotics, autonomous navigation, virtual reality and augmented reality.","['Epipolar Geometry', 'Camera Model', 'Camera Calibration', 'Structure from Motion', 'Simple Stereo']",15 ratings,"4,370 recent views","1,506 already enrolled"
785,3D Reconstruction - Single Viewpoint  | Coursera,Course,https://www.coursera.org/learn/3d-reconstruction---single-viewpoint,"This course focuses on the recovery of the 3D structure of a scene from its 2D images. In particular, we are interested in the 3D reconstruction of a rigid scene from images taken by a stationary camera (same viewpoint). This problem is interesting as we want the multiple images of the scene to capture complementary information despite the fact that the scene is rigid and the camera is fixed. To this end, we explore several ways of capturing images where each image provides additional information about the scene.In order to estimate scene properties (depth, surface orientation, material properties, etc.) we first define several important radiometric concepts, such as, light source intensity, surface illumination, surface brightness, image brightness and surface reflectance. Then, we tackle the challenging problem of shape from shading - recovering the shape of a surface from its shading in a single image. Next, we show that if multiple images of a scene of known reflectance are taken while changing the illumination direction, the surface normal at each scene point can be computed. This method, called photometric stereo, provides a dense surface normal map that can be integrated to obtain surface shape. 

Next, we discuss depth from defocus, which uses the limited depth of field of the camera to estimate scene structure. From a small number of images taken by changing the focus setting of the lens, a dense depth of the scene is recovered. Finally, we present a suite of techniques that use active illumination (the projection of light patterns onto the scene) to get precise 3D reconstructions of the scene. These active illumination methods are the workhorse of factory automation. They are used on manufacturing lines to assemble products and inspect their visual quality. They are also extensively used in other domains such as driverless cars, robotics, surveillance, medical imaging and special effects in movies.","['Photometric Stereo', 'Depth from Focus and Defocus', 'Structed Light Methods', 'Reflectance Models', 'Radiometry']",11 ratings,"4,439 recent views","1,685 already enrolled"

Cette derniÃ¨re est annoncÃ©e comme une rupture technologique majeure avec des dÃ©bits au delÃ  du Gbit/s, de trÃ¨s faibles latences et surtout une diffusion dans de nombreux secteurs d'activitÃ©s (industrie, transports, mÃ©decine, etc.).

Au delÃ  des effets d'annonce, cette technologie s'appuie fortement sur la 4G. La forme d'onde pour la transmission radio est identique, la gestion des flux de donnÃ©es est similaire. La 5G Ã©tend cependant notablement les options possibles tant dans les choix d'architectures que dans les configurations d'interface radio ainsi que dans les mÃ©canismes de sÃ©curitÃ©.

797,5G Network Fundamentals | Coursera,Course,https://www.coursera.org/learn/5g-network-fundamentals,"This MOOC presents the services and the architecture of 5G networks, the main principles of the new radio interface (NR), data flow management, security and the new Service-Based Architecture (SBA).In recent years, operators have been deploying 5G technology on commercial mobile networks. The latter is announced as a major technological breakthrough with speeds beyond Gbit/s, very low latencies and above all a distribution in many sectors of activity (industry, transport, medicine, etc.).

Beyond the announcement effects, this technology relies heavily on 4G. The waveform for radio transmission is identical, the management of data flows is similar. However, 5G significantly extends the possible options both in the choice of architectures and in the radio interface configurations as well as in the security mechanisms. All this is explained in the mooc.

806,A Business Approach to Sustainable Landscape Restoration | Coursera,Course,https://www.coursera.org/learn/landscape-restoration-sustainable-development,"Integrated landscape management and large-scale landscape restoration should be in every companyâs business strategy because in order to reach the Sustainable Development Goal on Land Degradation Neutrality (SDG Number 15.3) scaling up and acceleration of business-driven landscape restoration is urgently needed.This requires business professionals with a vision, the right knowledge and skills. This MOOC aims to train the next generation of business professionals and developers to acknowledge businessâ interdependency with healthy landscapes and understand the value of ecosystem resources.

âHistorically, we have found countless ways to justify our continued exploitation of the environment: discovery, tradition, Manifest Destiny, even Chinese hoax. But weâre all out of excuses now. Each passing day swells the data on greenhouse gases and extreme weather, shrinking reservoirs and rising sea levels, and diminishing biodiversity. Our resources are finite, the window for change if not firmly shut, is certainly closing, and all life must adapt or be doomed.â

TÃ©a Obreht, 
The New Yorker, Dec. 19&26, 2016, p. 106.

It is a frightening prospect indeed â that all life on Earth must either adapt or be doomed. This course is about landscape degradation â a global and wicked problem that is contributing to the dooming prospect of depletion of Earthâs finite resources. But this course is also about the solutions to this problem â business driven landscape restoration.
So rather than leaving you powerless with the prospect Obreht puts fowards above, it is our hope that you learn how you can be part of the solution to making sure that Planet Earth still provides a safe and habitable home for future generations. 
We must act big and we must act now.
With this course we want to pass on valuable knowledge and teach you useful skills that you can apply in your professional life that will enable you to tackle the issue of landscape degradation and restoration. 
The issue is urgent, so letâs dive right into it.

This MOOC is developed by the ENABLE partnership, which is co-funded by the ERASMUS+ programme of the European Commission and involves a diverse, international group of organizations including Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University, Commonland, United Nations University Land Restoration Training Programme, the Spanish National Research Council and Estoril Global Conferences.",,67 ratings,"11,233 recent views","9,370 already enrolled"
807,A Circular Economy of Metals: Towards a Sustainable Societal Metabolism | Coursera,Course,https://www.coursera.org/learn/circular-economy-metals,"Metals are present everywhere around us and are one of the major materials upon which our economies are built. Economic development is deeply coupled with the use of metals. During the 20th century, the variety of metal applications in society grew rapidly. In addition to mass applications such as steel in buildings and aluminium in planes, more and more different metals are in use for innovative technologies such as the use of the speciality metal indium in LCD screens.  A lot of metals will be needed in the future. It will not be easy to provide them. In particular in emerging economies, but also in industrialised countries, the demand for metals is increasing rapidly. Mining and production activities expand, and with that also the environmental consequences of metal production.  

In this course, we will explore those consequences and we will also explore options to move towards a more sustainable system of metals production and use. We will focus especially on the options to reach a circular economy for metals: keeping metals in use for a very long time, to avoid having to mine new ones.  

This course is based on the reports of the Global Metals Flows Group of the International Resource Panel that is part of UN Environment.  An important aspect that will come back each week, are the UN Sustainable Development Goals, the SDGs. Those are ambitious goals to measure our progress towards a more sustainable world. We will use the SDGs as a touching stone for the assessment of the metals challenge, as well as the solutions we present in this course to solve that challenge.",,80 ratings,"13,844 recent views","5,697 already enrolled"

This capstone will let you see how each component---problem formulation, algorithm selection, parameter selection and representation design---fits together into a complete solution, and how to make appropriate choices when deploying RL in the real world. This project will require you to implement both the environment to stimulate your problem, and a control agent with Neural Network function approximation. In addition, you will conduct a scientific study of your learning system to develop your ability to assess the robustness of RL agents. To use RL in the real world, it is critical to (a) appropriately formalize the problem as an MDP, (b) select appropriate algorithms, (c ) identify what choices in your implementation will have large impacts on performance and (d) validate the expected behaviour of your algorithms. This capstone is valuable for anyone who is planning on using RL to solve real problems.To be successful in this course, you will need to have completed Courses 1, 2, and 3 of this Specialization or the equivalent.

815,A Journey through Western Christianity: from Persecuted Faith to Global Religion (200 - 1650)  | Coursera,Course,https://www.coursera.org/learn/western-christianity-200-1650,"This course follows the extraordinary development of Western Christianity from its early persecution under the Roman Empire in the third century to its global expansion with the Jesuits of the early modern world. We explore the dynamic and diverse character of a religion with an enormous cast characters. We will meet men and women who tell stories of faith as well as of violence, suppression, and division. Along the way, we encounter Perpetua and her martyrdom in Carthage; the struggles of Augustine the bishop in North Africa; the zeal of Celtic monks and missionaries; the viciousness of the Crusades; the visions of Brigit of Sweden; and the fracturing of Christianity by Martin Lutherâs protest. We hear the voices of great theologians as well as of those branded heretics by the Church, a powerful reminder that the growth of Christianity is a story with many narratives of competing visions of reform and ideals, powerful critiques of corruption and venality, and exclusion of the vanquished.  The troubled history of Christian engagement with Jews and Muslims is found in pogroms and expulsions, but also in the astonishing ways in which the culture of the West was transformed by Jewish and Islamic learning.We shall explore the stunning beauty of the Book of Kells, exquisitely prepared by monks as the Vikings terrorized the coast of England. We will experience the blue light of the windows of Chartres, and ponder the opening questions of Thomas Aquinasâ great Summa. We will read from the Gutenberg Bible of the fifteenth century, which heralded the revolution brought by the printing press. We will travel from Calvinâs Geneva to Elizabethâs England to Trent, where a Catholic Council met to inaugurate a modern, missionary Catholic church. We will walk through the great Escorial of Philip II of Spain, hear the poetry of John of the Cross, and follow the Jesuits to Brazil and China.
 
Christianity in the West was forged in the fires of conflict and tumult, and it brought forth both creativity and violence. It echoed with calls for Godâs world to be transformed, it inspired the most sublime art and architecture, yet it also revealed the power of the union of cross and sword to destroy. The course is a journey through the formation of the West as one strand of Christianity, as one chapter in a global story.

817,A Life of Happiness and Fulfillment | Coursera,Course,https://www.coursera.org/learn/happiness,"What are the determinants of a happy and fulfilling life?This is surely one of lifeâs biggest questions, and a question that has interested many of our ancestors. Buddha famously gave up his kingdom in search of happiness. Several Greek philosophers (from Aristotle to Epicurus and Plato to Socrates) had their own views on what it takes to be happy. And of course, we all have our own theories about happiness too.

How valid are our theories?

Until recently, if you wished for an answer to this question, you would've been forced to base it on discussions with spiritual leaders. Or, if you were lucky, you could've based it on late-night (and perhaps intoxicant-fueled) conversations with friends and family. Happily, all that has changed now. Over the past decade-and-a-half, scientists have gotten into the act big time. We now have a pretty good idea of what it takes to lead a happy and fulfilling life.

This course, based on the award-winning class offered both at the Indian School of Business and at the McCombs School of Business at The University of Texas at Austin, developed by Prof. Raj Raghunathan (aka ""Dr. Happy-smarts"") draws content from a variety of fields, including psychology, neuroscience, and behavioral decision theory to offer a tested and practical recipe for leading a life of happiness and fulfillment. 

Although not mandatory, reading Prof. Raj's forthcoming book, titled If you're so smart, why aren't you happy? can help you review and assimilate the material covered in this book at your leisure. 

For Coursera learners alone, the hardcover version of the book is available for a deep discount of 50%, plus shipping and handling. You can order the hardcover for 50% off by writing to Aaron at: Aaron@800ceoread.com. Please mention that you are a student of the ""coursera happiness course"" in your email. 

The course will feature guest appearances by several well-known thought leaders, including:
      - Dan Ariely (author of Predictably Irrational and, soon to be released, Irrationally Yours),
      - Ed Diener (âDr. Happinessâ),
      - Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (author of Flow),

By taking this course, you will discover the answers to questions such as:
      - Why arenât the smart-and-the-successful as happy as they couldâor shouldâbe
      - What are the â7 Deadly Happiness Sinsâ that even the smart and the successful commit?, and
      - What are the â7 Habits of the Highly Happyâ and how can you implement them in your life?

By the end of the course, I expect students who have been diligent with the lectures and exercises to not just gain a deeper understanding of the science of happiness, but to also be significantly happier.","['Gratitude', 'Mindfulness', 'Happiness', 'Meditation']","5,704 ratings","123,206 recent views","454,232 already enrolled"

Os Ã¡lbuns deixaram de ser criados apenas em estÃºdios, agora tambÃ©m sÃ£o criados em quartos. Ã primeira vista, isso Ã© libertador. Qualquer pessoa pode criar um Ã¡lbum por um custo bem baixo, basta comprar alguns equipamentos e um pacote de software. Mas, se vocÃª for mais a fundo, verÃ¡ que nÃ£o Ã© tÃ£o fÃ¡cil assim. Ã preciso conhecimento, dedicaÃ§Ã£o e criatividade para produzir mÃºsica.
    
Fornecer conhecimento Ã© o propÃ³sito deste curso. NÃ£o importa o tipo de mÃºsica que vocÃª estÃ¡ produzindo, hÃ¡ um grande conjunto de ferramentas que vocÃª precisarÃ¡ usar.  Cada liÃ§Ã£o deste curso demonstrarÃ¡ um conjunto diferente de ferramentas de produÃ§Ã£o musical, seguindo vagamente o processo da produÃ§Ã£o musical de gravar, editar e mixar. 

Vamos comeÃ§ar com algumas noÃ§Ãµes sobre a natureza do som e como o percebemos. Em seguida, vamos analisar os componentes necessÃ¡rios para gravar Ã¡udio em um computador, para que vocÃª compreenda os dispositivos pelos quais o som precisa se deslocar em um processo de produÃ§Ã£o musical. 
    
Depois de gravado, o som precisa ser organizado em uma linha de tempo, um processo conhecido como ediÃ§Ã£o. A ediÃ§Ã£o nos permite dar a impressÃ£o de execuÃ§Ãµes perfeitas e criar muitos dos sons que ouvimos na mÃºsica contemporÃ¢nea. A ferramenta de ediÃ§Ã£o contemporÃ¢nea Ã© a estaÃ§Ã£o de trabalho de Ã¡udio digital (DAW, Digital Audio Workstation), um software que armazena e organiza todos os recursos de um projeto musical. Vamos focar as ferramentas de ediÃ§Ã£o que sÃ£o essenciais na produÃ§Ã£o de mÃºsica contemporÃ¢nea e que sÃ£o fornecidas por todas as DAWs. 

ApÃ³s a ediÃ§Ã£o, os sons devem ser combinados ou mixados, por isso vamos analisar a mesa de mixagem, que pode ser um local muito criativo se vocÃª souber usÃ¡-la. Vamos explorar as funcionalidades bÃ¡sicas das mesas de mixagem em hardware e software, inclusive volume, panning, mudo, solo, barramentos, inserÃ§Ãµes, envios e submixagens. O processo de mixagem, no entanto, engloba mais ferramentas do que a mesa de mixagem fornece. O som tambÃ©m deve ser processado, ou seja, modificado de modo a fazer com que seu estado gravado se enquadre no contexto da mÃºsica. Vamos analisar a compressÃ£o, a equalizaÃ§Ã£o e o retardo, alÃ©m de examinar os muitos efeitos de Ã¡udio que sÃ£o extensÃµes desses dispositivos e como eles sÃ£o usados em um contexto musical.
    
No fim das contas, o processo de produÃ§Ã£o musical depende da sua criatividade. A criatividade Ã© um produto da mente, e ela permanece armazenada ali, sem ser expressada, atÃ© que as ferramentas certas sÃ£o usadas da maneira certa para compartilhÃ¡-la com o mundo. Se vocÃª tem uma ideia em mente, precisarÃ¡ passar por inÃºmeras etapas, cada uma com uma ferramenta importante, para chegar ao seu pÃºblico.

901,"Abstraction, Problem Decomposition, and Functions | Coursera",Course,https://www.coursera.org/learn/abstraction-problem-decomposition-functions,"This course is the third course in the specialization exploring both computational thinking and beginning C programming. Rather than trying to define computational thinking, weâll just say itâs a problem-solving process that includes lots of different components. Most people have a better understanding of what beginning C programming means!This course assumes you have the prerequisite knowledge from the previous two courses in the specialization. You should make sure you have that knowledge, either by taking those previous courses or from personal experience, before tackling this course. The required prerequisite knowledge is listed below. 

Prerequisite computational thinking knowledge: Algorithms and procedures and data collection, analysis, and representation
Prerequisite C knowledge: Data types, variables, constants; STEM computations; selection; and iteration (looping)

Throughout this course the computational thinking topics you'll explore are abstraction, which is deciding which details matter for the problem you're trying to solve, and problem decomposition, which is about breaking large problems into smaller sub-problems to handle complexity. For the programming topics, you'll continue building on your C knowledge by practicing using arrays, which let you store multiple values in a single variable, and strings, which are arrays of characters. You'll also learn how to implement functions, which are the mechanism we use for problem decomposition in our C programs.

Module 1: Learn about arrays as a way to store multiple values in a single variable
Module 2: Discover how we store and process strings (arrays of characters)
Module 3: Explore abstraction and problem decomposition
Module 4: Use functions to implement problem decomposition in your code",,33 ratings,"2,571 recent views","3,552 already enrolled"

Sports and political change walk hand in hand in America. The way that athletes and institutions deal with questions of race, economic hardship, nationalism, and political ties have become central to the way that we understand ourselves and our society. And yet, there are those who would prefer their sports free of controversy and opinion. Dedicated athletes, coaches, and media personalities have pushed back against this refrain, demanding to be seen not just as entertainers but as fully formed humans with political opinions and experiences. Their struggles against injustice have changed the face of America and kicked off a reckoning within modern-day sports. How does context inform the shape and outcome of protests? What is it about sports that provides space â or doesn't â for political statements? Why do some of us expect athletes to be activists, when others would rather they ""shut up and dribble""? We'll explore all of these questions and more in this class. 

Your professor will be NBA All-Star and TNT Sports journalist and commentator Chris Webber, who leads interviews with iconic activists, including John Carlos and Jemele Hill as they wrestle with the meanings and outcomes of their activism. You'll read and watch primary source documents about acts of protest, and academic and journalistic work that reckons with the legacies of those acts. By the end of the course, you'll have a better understanding of historical and contemporary protest moments, and be able to create and apply new ways of thinking about the activism within the world of sports in history and today.",,11 ratings,"2,294 recent views",

Adaptability is everything. â Jeff Boss, ForbesAdaptability refers to your ability change your actions, course, or approach in order to suit different conditions or environments. Adaptability implies a sense of personal choice, of purposefully navigatingârather than being driven byâchanging circumstances. 

Resilience is the capacity to recover quickly from difficulties. Resilience gives you the ability to bounce forward with new insights and learning you can carry into the future. 

Both adaptability and resilience include the ability to assess an evolving situation from multiple perspectives, to shift thinking and viewpoint, and to choose the best response. Adaptable people flourish amidst chaos while inflexible people flounder. Adapters find openings in situations where others only see closure. This 4-module course will give you knowledge and tools to become more adaptable and resilient in your workplace and in your life.","['Personal Advertisement', 'Planning', 'Adaptability', 'Resilience']",201 ratings,"43,851 recent views","7,270 already enrolled"

In this capstone project, you will analyze the data on financial loans to help with the investment decisions of an investment company. You will go through all typical steps of a data analytics project, including data understanding and cleanup, data analysis, and presentation of analytical results. 
For the first week, the goal is to understand the data and prepare the data for analysis. As we discussed  in this specialization, data preprocessing and cleanup is often the first step in data analytics projects. Needless to say, this step is crucial for the success of this project.  

In the second week, you will perform some predictive analytics tasks, including classifying loans and predicting losses from defaulted loans. You will try a variety of tools and techniques  this week, as the predictive accuracy of different tools can vary quite a bit. It is rarely the case that the default model produced by ASP is the best model possible. Therefore, it is important for you to tune the different models in order to improve the performance.

Beginning in the third week, we turn our attention to prescriptive analytics, where you will provide some concrete suggestions on how to allocate investment funds using analytics tools, including clustering and simulation based optimization. You will see that allocating funds wisely is crucial for the financial return of the investment portfolio.

In the last week, you are expected to present your analytics results to your clients.

This project course investigates the dynamics of a complex spacecraft system where there is a rigid hub onto which a hinged panel is attached.  This simulates a spacecraft with a time varying geometry.First, the three-dimensional kinematics of this system are explored.  Analytical relationships of the body and panel position and velocity states are derived, and the center of mass properties of this system are explored.

Next, a simplified system is used to use Lagrange's equations of motion to predict the dynamical response.  With these differential equations we are then able to apply attitude control torques and investigate the rotational response if the spacecraft hub has a spring-hinged panel attached.  Two open-loop control torque solutions are investigated.  The classical minimum time bang-bang control solution is applied first, illustrating how such a control can yield unwanted panel oscillations.  Finally, a filtered version of the bang-bang control is applied to illustrated how the panel oscillations can be significantly reduced at the cost of a slightly longer nominal maneuver time.","['input shaped attitude control', 'time varying geometry', 'spacecraft simulation', 'center of mass properties']",,,

1030,Advanced Reproducibility in Cancer Informatics | Coursera,Course,https://www.coursera.org/learn/adv-reproducibility-cancer-informatics,"This course introduces tools that help enhance reproducibility and replicability in the context of cancer informatics. It uses hands-on exercises to demonstrate in practical terms how to get acquainted with these tools but is by no means meant to be a comprehensive dive into these tools.  The course introduces tools and their concepts such as git and GitHub, code review, Docker, and GitHub actions.Target Audience  

The course is intended for students in the biomedical sciences and researchers who use informatics tools in their research. It is the follow up course to the Introduction to Reproducibility in Cancer Informatics course. Learners who take this course should: 

- Have some familiarity with R or Python
- Have take the Introductory Reproducibility in Cancer Informatics course
- Have some familiarity with GitHub

Motivation

Data analyses are generally not reproducible without direct contact with the original researchers and a substantial amount of time and effort (BeaulieuJones, 2017). Reproducibility in cancer informatics (as with other fields) is still not monitored or incentivized despite that it is fundamental to the scientific method. Despite the lack of incentive, many researchers strive for reproducibility in their own work but often lack the skills or training to do so effectively.

Equipping researchers with the skills to create reproducible data analyses increases the efficiency of everyone involved. Reproducible analyses are more likely to be understood, applied, and replicated by others. This helps expedite the scientific process by helping researchers avoid false positive dead ends. Open source clarity in reproducible methods also saves researchers' time so they don't have to reinvent the proverbial wheel for methods that everyone in the field is already performing.

Curriculum  

The course includes hands-on exercises for how to apply reproducible code concepts to their code. Individuals who take this course are encouraged to complete these activities as they follow along with the course material to help increase the reproducibility of their analyses.

**Goal of this course:**  
To equip learners with a deeper knowledge of the capabilities of reproducibility tools and how they can apply to their existing analyses scripts and projects.


**What is NOT the goal of this course:**  
To be a comprehensive dive into each of the tools discussed. .

Would you like to learn about the latest valuation methods that may help you to make better business decisions? Then 'Advanced Valuation and Strategy â M&A, Private Equity, and Venture Capital' by Erasmus University Rotterdam is the right course for you! This course is helpful for executives that need to value complete strategies and for all students interested in corporate finance and strategy. We present the latest tools and show you how to apply them!

We will revolutionize your way of decision making, by extending static techniques from corporate finance with dynamic methods to quantify strategic thinking. Traditionally, we assess the attractiveness of an investment as a mature business, where future cash flows mainly result from past decisions. But, in an ever-changing world, strategic decisions determine the firmâs long-term success and market value. Yet managers often have to consider these long-term implications using intuition and experience alone, with little guidance from structured, quantitative analysis.

Our treatment goes far beyond the use of standard valuation analysis. We introduce the expanded NPV, which brings together DCF, real options, and game theory. Thinking in terms of options, games, and adaptive strategies may help managers address strategic questions such as: How do you value a leveraged buyout? How can you value a high-tech venture with negative cash flows? When should you invest in new ventures in stages? How can you incorporate rival bidders in the analysis?

The tools we provide can improve your decisions in business and in daily life.

* Who is this class for?
We hope that our course appeals to (graduate) students in finance, economics, and business, as well as to high-ranking professionals and a general audience.

1056,After the Arab Spring â Democratic Aspirations and State Failure | Coursera,Course,https://www.coursera.org/learn/after-the-arab-spring,"Learn why the hope and excitement of the Arab Spring is gone, why so many Arab states are falling apart, why the youth are so frustrated, why there are so many refugees, and what can be done about it.The so-called Arab Spring appeared to end decades of exceptionalism and bring the Arab world back into the mainstream of global developments. The rebellions promised the return of politics and the reassertion of popular sovereignty against their corrupt and geriatric leaders. Much hope and flowery language greeted the young men and women who deposed their leaders and tried to build new, better societies.

Today, the Arab world is in deep crisis. Of the 22 member states of the Arab League, at least five have essentially collapsed: Iraq, Libya, Yemen, Somalia and Syria exist only in name today, as their territories have fallen to competing, murderous armed groups. In the remaining countries, the old autocracies have reasserted themselves. The repression at home is now worsened by regional conflict on an unprecedented scale, and the resulting frustration has led to the biggest refugee flows in recent memory. What went wrong?

This course offers an overview of the structural shortcomings of Arab states and societies, which help us understand why the democratic awakening did not happen but instead âhas given way to civil wars, ethnic, sectarian and regional divisions and the reassertion of absolutism.â This raises the obvious and renewed question whether there is something inherent in the Arab, and by analogy Muslim, condition that makes them special. Does this condition make this part of the world impervious to generally observable trends towards greater accountability, popular participation in political decision-making, greater generation and fairer division of economic wealth?

Rather than trying to define computational thinking, weâll just say itâs a problem-solving process that includes lots of different components. In this course, weâll explore algorithms and data collection.

Most people have a better understanding of what beginning C programming means! Youâll start learning how to develop C programs in this course by writing your first C program; learning about data types, variables, and constants; and honing your C programming skills by implementing a variety of STEM computations. This course doesn't assume you have any previous programming experience, so don't worry if you've never written code before.

If that all sounds interesting to you, go ahead and jump into the course!

Caution: Beginning (assuming no prior programming knowledge) is not the same as easy (not hard to do). Learning to program IS hard to do, especially since the courses in this specialization are built from a freshman-level college course. Meeting the course challenges while you master the material will be rewarding to you, but doing that will require hard work and maybe even a few expletives along the way.

It assumes you have a strong foundation in spacecraft dynamics and control, including particle dynamics, rotating frame, rigid body kinematics and kinetics.  The focus of the course is to understand key analytical mechanics methodologies to develop equations of motion in an algebraically efficient manner.  The course starts by first developing DâAlembertâs principle and how the associated virtual work and virtual displacement concepts allows us to ignore non-working force terms.  Unconstrained systems and holonomic constrains are investigated.  Next Kane's equations and the virtual power form of D'Alembert's equations are briefly reviewed for particles.Next Lagrangeâs equations are developed which still assume a finite set of generalized coordinates, but can be applied to multiple rigid bodies as well.  Lagrange multipliers are employed to apply Pfaffian constraints.  

Finally, Hamiltonâs extended principle is developed to allow us to consider a dynamical system with flexible components.  Here there are an infinite number of degrees of freedom.  The course focuses on how to develop spacecraft related partial differential equations, but does not study numerically solving them.  The course ends comparing the presented assumed mode methods to classical final element solutions.","['Lagrangian Dynamics', 'holonomic constraints', ""D'Alembert's Principle"", ""Hamilton's Extended Principle"", 'multi-body dynamics']",,"3,662 recent views",

1202,"Anatomy of the Chest, Neck, Abdomen, and Pelvis | Coursera",Course,https://www.coursera.org/learn/trunk-anatomy,"WARNING: THESE VIDEOS CONTAIN IMAGES OF HUMAN DISSECTION. MAY BE DISTURBING TO SOME.Human structure is important to all of us as it has been for millennia.  Artists, teachers, health care providers, scientists and most children try to understand the human form from stick figure drawings to electron microscopy. Learning the form of people is of great interest to us â physicians, nurses, physician assistants, emergency medical services personnel and many, many others.

Learning anatomy classically involved dissection of the deceased whether directly in the laboratory or from texts, drawings, photographs or videos.  There are many wonderful resources for the study of anatomy.  Developing an understanding of the human form requires significant work and a wide range of resources.

In this course, we have attempted to present succinct videos of human anatomy.  Some will find these images to be disturbing and these images carry a need to respect the individual who decided to donate their remains to benefit our teaching and learning.

All of the dissections depicted in the following videos are from individuals who gave their remains to be used in the advancement of medical education and research after death to the Yale School of Medicine.

The sequence of videos is divided into classic anatomic sections.  Each video has a set of learning objectives and a brief quiz at the end.  Following each section there is another quiz covering the entire section in order for you to test your knowledge.  

We hope these videos will help you better understand the human form, make time that you may have in the laboratory more worthwhile if you have that opportunity and help you develop an appreciation of the wonderful intricacies of people.

In fifth-century Athens, Socrates insisted on the importance of the fundamental ethical questionââHow shall I live?ââand his pupil, Plato, and Platoâs pupil, Aristotle, developed elaborate philosophical systems to explain the nature of reality, knowledge, and human happiness.

Module 3 examines the dark side of these relationships, focusing on animal abuse and its relationship to domestic violence. Module 4 focuses on peopleâs encounters with those animals outside the boundaries of the home and the farm. The way people understand and regard the species commonly considered âwildâ shapes the treatment and moral status of these animals.","['Animal welfare', 'Sociological concepts']",88 ratings,"6,871 recent views","3,959 already enrolled"

- Use and comprehend contemporary intersectional terminology through a provided glossary
- Critically discuss âwhitenessâ
- Recognize the concept of White privilege that all White people have whether they want that privilege or not and to differentiate between White supremacy as a systemic concept vs. White supremacists (who are professional racists like the KKK).
- Distinguish between being not racist and being anti-racist
- Define systemic and institutional racism 
- Accept the unequal history of race and racism in the United States that has created racial hierarchies that has disenfranchised Black Americans
- Share with others the true foundations of United Statesâs histories beginning with the acknowledgement of settler colonialism and the rewards that White people have received due to White supremacy and Black oppression.
- Talk about race and racism
- Explain why phrases like âAll Lives Matterâ and âBlue Lives Matterâ are racist
- Recognize that anyone can be anti-racist--it only takes the dedication and decision to be anti-racist, to educate yourself about the history of racism in the US and then to talk in an anti-racist way and to act as an anti-racist

Anti-Racism II takes on the vital role assisting students in guiding their own conversations regarding race, and additionally gender and sexuality. Anti-Racism II will expand your knowledge and critically engage your inquiry, centering upon short interviews with leading scholars and activists in the field.   Coupled with supplementary video and reading material, these interviews will further demonstrate the power of open dialogue and self-narration, directing you towards being an anti-racist ally. The centrality of the course interviews will culminate in a final project where students will construct and carry out their own personalized interview. The final project will test dialogic skills while asserting the importance of intimate conversations about race, gender, and sexuality. 

This is challenging work in troubling times that may conjure uneasy feelings and emotions. Anti-Racism II can work as a bridge coming face to face with your personal individual relationship with social demands plaguing us nationally and globally.

The course version on Coursera does not offer CME credit.

Course Description
Antibiotics are among the most frequently prescribed classes of drugs and it is estimated that approximately 50% of antibiotic use, in both the outpatient and inpatient settings, is inappropriate. At the same time, in contrast to any other class of drugs, every antibiotic use has a potential public health consequence â inappropriate use may not harm only the individual patient, but contributes to societal harm by exerting an unnecessary selective pressure that may lead to antibiotic resistance among bacteria. This video based course will introduce learners to the basic principles of appropriate antibiotic use, demonstrate how to apply these principles to the management of common infections, and outline how to develop and maintain an antimicrobial stewardship program. We will offer a number of illustrative cases, recognizable to the practicing physician in his or her practice to engage learners in the thought processes that lead to optimal decision making, improved outcomes of individual patients, and harm reduction vis-a-vis the bacterial ecology. The course will also explore strategies to implement principles of antimicrobial stewardship both in your practice and also at a program level.",,303 ratings,"35,126 recent views","37,743 already enrolled"

Students will learn how to critically analyse the power dynamics present between multidisciplinary stakeholders and appreciate the need for reciprocity between those delivering and those receiving health care; between both those conducting and those participating in research. They will also learn how to select and evaluate different participatory approaches to apply these to public health programmes and/or research. Tools with which to do this include undertaking a stakeholder-mapping exercise and needs assessment, including a critical and reasoned narrative to justify the approach.  While this course, as with the rest of the specialisation, focuses on public health and ways of involving citizens and patients in programmes and research, these concepts apply to other disciplines too. So, you don't have to be a public health specialist or work in healthcare to gain insight from this course. 

If you would like to learn more about the theories and core principles of participation within a public health context, we suggest taking Introduction to Participatory Approaches in Public Health.

With over 4,000 universities in the United States and no standard application system, the U.S. admission process can be confusing for everyone, but especially for students applying from other countries.This course will help international students (non-U.S. citizens) and non-native English speakers navigate the U.S. university admission process by offering practical information about the documents and pieces that make up a U.S. university application.  More importantly, admission officers will discuss how they use those pieces to decide who is accepted and who is denied, so that you can understand the process beyond the pieces.

By the end of this course, you will understand application basics that include researching schools, creating a school list, and establishing an application plan.  This course will not answer all of your application questions, but it will teach you to ask the right questions of yourself and the universities.  Ultimately, you will have all the information you need to start your process the right way, putting you on the path to acceptance.

* Please note, while the English Language Programs are part of the University of Pennsylvania, this is not a course about applying to Penn.  Furthermore, this course is intended for international students educated in the national curriculum of their country.  While other students are welcome to enroll, the course is not intended for American students or students studying in an American, International Baccalaureate, or Advanced Placement curriculum.  The course is also intended for students who do not have access to university counseling â if you attend a school that offers university counseling, your counselor is the best source of information on applying to university.  Finally, this course is for undergraduate (Bachelors degree) freshmen (students who have not attended any university) applicants.  Undergraduate transfer applicants, students who have attended a university, will find some of the information helpful, but graduate (Masters and Doctoral) applicants will not.",,486 ratings,"69,710 recent views","100,079 already enrolled"

It is about the relationship between the technical and aesthetic details of music. It is also about how developing a meaningful theoretical vocabulary can help you think and talk about musical style, and how learning that vocabulary can expand your appreciation for music.In this course you will learn music theory not by looking at theory itself, but by listening to, looking at, andâyes!âwriting your own musical examples. By hearing, seeing, and writing yourself, you will learn about classical, modern, ancient, pop, jazz, and folk styles.

Through lectures, relevant examples, and numerous practice assignments, we will examine fundamental aspects of melody. We will move into working with two voices and counterpoint, and finally to three voices and the beginnings of harmonic function.

This is an intermediate-level course for musicians and composers who already have some understanding of music theory through previous study. If you are a musician or composer looking to build a deeper understanding of music theory for composing, performing, or improvisation, you have come to the right place. If you are an amateur lover of music or, perhaps, play a musical instrument and want to develop a deeper sense of appreciation for music theory, aesthetics, and history, you are also in the right place!","['Music', 'Classical Music', 'Jazz', 'Music composition', 'Music theory']",140 ratings,"26,351 recent views","39,410 already enrolled"

1320,Approximation Algorithms | Coursera,Course,https://www.coursera.org/learn/approximation-algorithms,"Many real-world algorithmic problems cannot be solved efficiently using traditional algorithmic tools, for example because the problems are NP-hard. The goal of this course is to become familiar with important algorithmic concepts and techniques needed to effectively deal with such problems. These techniques apply when we don't require the optimal solution to certain problems, but an approximation that is close to the optimal solution. We will see how to efficiently find such approximations. Prerequisites:
In order to successfully take this course, you should already have a basic knowledge of algorithms and mathematics. Here's a short list of what you are supposed to know:
- O-notation, Î©-notation, Î-notation; how to analyze algorithms
- Basic calculus: manipulating summations, solving recurrences, working with logarithms, etc.
- Basic probability theory: events, probability distributions, random variables, expected values etc.
- Basic data structures: linked lists, stacks, queues, heaps
- (Balanced) binary search trees
- Basic sorting algorithms, for example MergeSort, InsertionSort, QuickSort
- Graph terminology, representations of graphs (adjacency lists and adjacency matrix), basic graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, topological sort, shortest paths)

The material for this course is based on the course notes that can be found under the resources tab.  We will not cover everything from the course notes. The course notes are there both for students who did not fully understand the lectures as well as for students who would like to dive deeper into the topics.

It is most likely impossible to solve such problems efficiently, so our aim is to give an approximate solution that can be computed in polynomial time and that at the same time has provable guarantees on its cost relative to the optimum. 

This course assumes knowledge of a standard undergraduate Algorithms course, and particularly emphasizes algorithms that can be designed using linear programming, a favorite and amazingly successful technique in this area. By taking this course, you will be exposed to a range of problems at the foundations of theoretical computer science, and to powerful design and analysis techniques. Upon completion, you will be able to recognize, when faced with a new combinatorial optimization problem, whether it is close to one of a few known basic problems, and will be able to design linear programming relaxations and use randomized rounding to attempt to solve your own problem.

1383,Arduino y algunas aplicaciones | Coursera,Course,https://www.coursera.org/learn/arduino-aplicaciones,"Arduino es una iniciativa empleada para simplificar el uso de los microcontroladores, que surgiÃ³ en 2005 como resultado de un proyecto de estudiantes en el Instituto IVREA. NaciÃ³ con el objetivo de disminuir el costo de los microcontroladores, que entonces los estudiantes empleaban para sus proyectos y que resultaban demasiado costosos. Actualmente tiene diferentes usos, como la aplicaciÃ³n de desarrolladores de diseÃ±os artÃ­sticos e interactivos; de igual forma, muchas personas utilizan Arduino para incursionar en aplicaciones tecnolÃ³gicas, como la automatizaciÃ³n y la robÃ³tica.

Su aplicaciÃ³n, aunque pudiera parecer limitada a Ã¡reas de la ciencia muy especializadas, es en realidad comÃºn, al encontrarla en un cajero automÃ¡tico, un calentador de agua, la pluma de un estacionamiento o las puertas de una plaza o supermercado, y es que este tipo de herramientas, que facilitan nuestra vida diaria, estÃ¡n basadas en un pequeÃ±o microcontrolador, cuya tarea estÃ¡ dictada por un programa.

Programar es algo que hacemos dÃ­a con dÃ­a al planear nuestras actividades, pero si nos detenemos a organizar aquello que hacemos de manera inconsciente, obtendremos una serie ordenada de pasos que nos llevarÃ¡n a un objetivo; si tenemos esto claro seremos capaces de planear actividades mÃ¡s complejas.

En este curso utilizaremos Arduino UNO para realizar dos prototipos que muestran el funcionamiento de dispositivos, como un chaleco para ciclista y un pastillero. No es requisito tener conocimientos de programaciÃ³n; sin embargo, conforme avances en el estudio de este curso probablemente necesites reforzar e investigar sobre algunos de los aspectos que aquÃ­ se expliquen.

A travÃ©s de las actividades y material didÃ¡ctico de este curso aprenderÃ¡s a aplicar la tarjeta Arduino y podrÃ¡s adquirir y reforzar nociones bÃ¡sicas de programaciÃ³n, utilizando una herramienta de fÃ¡cil acceso, que te permitirÃ¡ ademÃ¡s elaborar posteriores proyectos de tu interÃ©s.

1411,Artificial Intelligence: Ethics & Societal Challenges | Coursera,Course,https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-ethics,"Artificial Intelligence: Ethics & Societal Challenges is a four-week course that explores ethical and societal aspects of the increasing use of artificial intelligent technologies (AI). The aim of the course is to raise awareness of ethical and societal aspects of AI and to stimulate reflection and discussion upon implications of the use of AI in society. The course consists of four modules where each module represents about one week of part-time studies. A module includes a number of lectures and readings. Each lesson finishes with a mandatory assignment in which you write a short sum-up of the most important new knowledge/insight you gained from this lesson, and review a lesson sum-up written by another student/participant. The assessments are intended to encourage learning and to stimulate reflection on ethical and societal issues of the use of AI in society. Participating in forum discussions is voluntary but strongly encouraged.

In the first module, we will discuss algorithmic bias and surveillance. Is it really true that algorithms are purely logical and free from human biases or are they maybe just as biased as we are, and if they are, why is that and what can we do about it? AI in many ways makes surveillance more effective, but what does it mean to us if we are increasingly being watched in more and more sophisticated ways? 

Next, we will talk about the impact of AI on democracy. We discuss why democracy is important, and how AI could hamper public democratic discussion, but also how it can help improve democracy. We will for instance talk about how social media could play in the hands of authoritarian regimes and present some ideas on how to make use of AI tools to develop the functioning of democracy.

A further ethical question concerns whether our treatment of AI could matter for the AIs themselves. Can artefacts be conscious? What do we even mean by âconsciousâ? What is the relationship between consciousness and intelligence? This is the topic of the third week of the course. 

In the last module we will talk about responsibility and control. If an autonomous car hits an autonomous robot, who is responsible? And who is responsible to make sure AI is developed in a safe and democratic way? 

The last question of the course, and maybe also the ultimate question for our species, is how to control machines that are more intelligent than we are. Our intelligence has given us a lot of power over the world we live in. Shall we really give that power away to machines and if we do, how do we stay in charge?

At the end of the course, you will have 
Â·      a basic understanding of the AI bias phenomenon and the role of AI in surveillance, 
Â·      a basic understanding of the importance of democracy in relation to AI and acquaintance with common issues with democracy in relation to AI, 
Â·      an understanding of the complexity of the concepts âintelligenceâ and âconsciousnessâ and acquaintance with common approaches to creating artificial consciousness,

Over the past decades, a new figure has emerged that of the art manager. Imagine you went to work every day to connect artists with audiences, vision with reality, and money with a mission. That is what managers in the arts do, they play an essential role in transforming the minds, lives, and communities through creative expression.
	
This course has been conceptualized to address the need of skills and techniques to help professionals and managers in running art and cultural institutions. 

Learning Objectives
There are three objectives to this course. First, we will approach the biggest issue cultural institutions face, the coexistence of managers and curators and giving evidence as to when, how, and why they can get along. Second, we will focus on some contemporary facets on what is means to manage a cultural institution and what cultural managers should expect and be able to face. And lastly, we will provide models and tools to design and implement appropriate courses of action to satisfy customers (visitors and audiences) and build an advantage over the competition.

Course Structure
The course is divided into six sections. Five sections are dedicated to specific aspects and themes of managing cultural institutions, while the sixth section is dedicated to individual interviews of prominent cultural institution managers on specific topics. The involvement of professionals and managers gives an incredible value to the learning experience of this course. 

Each module is paired with aÂ quizÂ and discussion forums to reflect on the variety of the heritage management, its complexity, and the power of the network that we will build together during the course.
Successful completion of the quizzes is required for a course certificate as explained in the Grading Policy page.

If you love art and want to make an impact in this unique and fantastic sector, this course will support you in understanding the peculiarities of this sector and how to leverage on its tools to make a bigger impact.

Look forward to meeting you online!

You will learn about concepts of landscape in Asian religions, philosophy, social sciences, history and the arts and their reverberation in selected environmental projects in China, India and Japan. Furthermore, we will discuss how they are critically reflected upon in the context of the environmental humanities, and observe how an interdisciplinary approach towards regional ecosystems past and present reaches out beyond pragmatic technological solutions to mitigate environmental damage. Following us on our different paths and trajectories through the five modules of the course, you will encounter many of the reasons why environmental humanities study projects which strive to change peopleâs prevalent attitudes, values and behavioural patterns in order to redeem the rapidly globalizing crisis, and how they go about it. Having acquainted yourself with the stories Asiaâs landscapes â and landscape representations â tell about actual and possible human-nature relationships, you can compare and evaluate their potential to bring about the desired change and define your own range of actions as an informed stakeholder for creating a sustainable future. What is arguably no less intriguing: you will learn how to appreciate a broad range of eco-aesthetic forms that re-enchant our lives by creatively interacting with the more-than-human world.

1447,Assessment for Learning | Coursera,Course,https://www.coursera.org/learn/assessmentforlearning,"For several decades now, assessment has become an increasingly pressing educational priority. Teacher and school accountability systems have come to be based on analysis of large-scale, standardized summative assessments. As a consequence, assessment now dominates most conversations about reform, particularly as a measure of teacher and school accountability for learner performance. Behind the often heated and at times ideologically gridlocked debate is a genuine challenge to address gaps in achievement between different demographically identifiable groups of students. There is an urgent need to lift whole communities and cohorts of students out of cycles of underachievement. For better or for worse, testing and public reporting of achievement is seen to be one of the few tools capable of clearly informing public policy makers and communities alike about how their resources are being used to expand the life opportunities for their children. This course is an overview of current debates about testing, and analyses the strengths and weaknesses of a variety of approaches to assessment. The course also focuses on the use of assessment technologies in learning. It will explore recent advances in computer adaptive and diagnostic testing, the use of natural language processing technologies in assessments, and embedded formative assessments in digital and online curricula. Other topics include the use of data mining, learning analytics and artificial intelligence in learning management systems and educational technology platforms. Participants will be required to consider issues of data access, privacy and the challenges raised by âbig dataâ including data persistency and student profiling.--------------------------------

And which elements did contribute to build up that baulk of customs, ideas, and innovations which compelled to confrontation and hybridizations different peoples for millennia? What did it made, from pottery to metallurgy, from gastronomy to architecture, from art to religion, of a sea a cradle of civilization? Archaeology may help in disentangling such questions, seeking unexpected answers , by tinkering what ancient Mediterranean peoples left buried in the ground. A privileged point of view of our course is the ancient Phoenician city of Motya, located exactly at the centre of the âsea in the middleâ. Throughout the live experience of excavation, with images taken on the field, this course will let you touch the many tesserae of the great mosaic of the Mediterranean Civilization. The field diary of the archaeologist, and the handpick will be the two tools, which will lead us across the sea to discover what such early cities actually were, and how their contribute is still a major part of our shared memory.",,388 ratings,"19,991 recent views","17,174 already enrolled"

1461,Attitude Control with Momentum Exchange Devices | Coursera,Course,https://www.coursera.org/learn/attitude-control-momentum-exchange-devices,"This course is part 1 of the specialization Advanced Spacecraft Dynamics and Control. It is a direct continuation of the Coursera specialization Spacecraft Dynamics and Control.  This first course focuses on nonlinear attitude feedback control using a range of angular momentum devices.  The course provides a comprehensive review of prerequisite material.  Next it develops equations of motion of a spacecraft with momentum exchange devices such as reaction wheels (RWs), control momentum gyroscopes (CMGs) and variable speed control moment gyroscopes (VSCMGs). The course discusses developing a complex spacecraft simulation with a number VSCMGs and how to approach debugging such complex software.  The use of the work/energy theorem is discussed to assist with debugging the simulation by validating angular momentum, energy, changes in momentum and mechanical power. 

Further, the use of null motion is explored to reconfigure the attitude control devices to avoid singularities and gimbal lock.  The redundancy is exploited to seek control solutions that avoid classical CMG singularities.","['Variable Speed Control Moment Gyroscopes', 'Control Moment Gyroscopes (CMGs)', 'Nonlinear Attitude Control', 'RW Performance Envelopes', 'Reaction Wheels']",,"3,643 recent views",

1463,Attracting and Sourcing Diverse Candidates | Coursera,Course,https://www.coursera.org/learn/attracting-and-sourcing-diverse-cadidates,"It is during the shortlisting and interviewing processes, which are typically undertaken by a single panel, that candidates most often report being unfairly assessed during recruitment efforts. In this situation, it is often revealed that personal characteristics, such as age, gender, or race, rather than relevant characteristics, such as skills and experience, fed into a particular decision about who to hire. In this module, you will learn how unconscious bias can affect the shortlisting and interview processes. You will become familiar with various practical strategies and techniques to forward a fair and merit-based assessment of all candidates.
