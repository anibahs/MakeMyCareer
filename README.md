<h2>Description</h2>
<br>
<p>Searching for a new job is a huge task. However, when you want a fresh start or a change in your career, you will need help in the form of advice and an outside perspective. When you want to go beyond your current role, and explore new roles, you can achieve it by simply adding a few more skills to the ones you already have under your belt. We have a system that will help you achieve this monumental change.</p>

<p>MakeMyCareer is a system that will provide suggestions to a user in the form of prospective careers, positions, skills, and resources to add to their profile based on their current skills, expectations, and the job market. Also, the user will be able to make their profile impressive and enticing to prospective recruiters in terms of their resume, and their online presence for an easy hiring process.</p>

<h3>The System will provide -</h3>
<p>
<ol><li>Prospective Positions or Profiles based on the current skills a user already has, their work experience, expectations, and the demand in the job market. These expectations can include requirements like salary, work-life balance, and ideologies.</li>

<li>Based on a Target Position, the user will want to know any additional skills missing from their profile. These will be looked up and filtered using the latter parameters, and the user's target companies.</li>

<li>Once the user knows the skills required, they would need trending and quality resources to learn these skills. These will be searched, based on the profile and target companies.</li>

<li>Additional resources like suggestions to add to your profile, for eg, a personal website, projects, social media, etc, to improve their profile. Attributes and features of trending user profiles will be maintained and searched.</li>

<li>Once they are all set, for a final polish, the user can add trending Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Keywords to their profile, which the system will provide based on their skills and experience, target companies, target profile, and trending user profiles.</li>
