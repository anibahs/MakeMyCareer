How do we decide when weâ\\x80\\x99re moving forward and not taking steps backward? And how do we explore the idea of progress around public sites of memory? This Teach-Out is an invitation to think about what progress means, and how you can look for it wherever you areâ\\x80\\x94in your city, community, or neighborhoodâ\\x80\\x94and reflect upon your own ideas about the place you live in.Changes in the built environment of our communities are themselves the result of human actions and intentions, such as municipal planning, commercial enterprises, or communities transforming their own space. In other words, in our cities we can see the results of our plansâ\\x80\\x94our attempts to create and shape the future. Neighbors, political groups, corporations, governments, schools, and other organizations, they all shape the community, leaving traces that allow us to see in what directions they transformed our lives. \\n\\nThis Teach-Out will ask the following questions:\\nâ\\x80¢\\tWhat are the forces that shape and change the places we inhabit? \\nâ\\x80¢\\tHow do people connect with places in our modern cities? \\nâ\\x80¢\\tDo places progress? \\nâ\\x80¢\\tHow can we measure in them whether there is any â\\x80\\x9cprogressâ\\x80\\x9d? \\n\\nWe will interview a number of people who work in Atlanta, Georgia, but the questions and places we will see here are comparable to many of other places in the world on what it means to progress. In this Teach-Out you will learn how to find the history of public spaces in any community and how to reflect upon the idea of progress. Finally, you can join a conversation to discuss what has been explored, uncovered, and possibly transformed both within ourselves and our communities.\\n\\nA Teach-Out is: \\nâ\\x80\\x93 an event â\\x80\\x93 it takes place over a fixed, short period of time \\nâ\\x80\\x93 an opportunity â\\x80\\x93 it is open for free participation to everyone around the world \\nâ\\x80\\x93 a community â\\x80\\x93 it will be joined by a large number of diverse individuals \\nâ\\x80\\x93 a conversation â\\x80\\x93 an opportunity to give and take ideas and information from people \\n\\nThis community learning event invites participants from around the world to come together in conversation with the Emory campus community, including faculty experts. This Teach-Out is part of Emoryâ\\x80\\x99s commitment to engage the local and global community in exploring and understanding problems, events, and phenomena most important to our society. \\n\\nOriginating from University of Michigan (Teach-Out.org), Teach-Outs are short learning experiences focused on a specific current issue. Attendees will come together over a few days not only to learn about a subject or event but also to gain skills.

Like so many of my colleagues, however, I was unprepared for the wave of mental health challenges that would face our society in 2020. From COVID-19 and the devastating economic impacts of the pandemic to racial justice protests, widespread natural disasters, our current cultural moment presents unprecedented mental health concerns, and particularly for marginalized communities. For this reason, I led a field-wide call to action for mental health research and treatment that resulted in this #TalkMentalIllness course. I had the opportunity to speak to over 30 experts from different domains in psychology research, practice, and popular public figures and to discuss the causes and cutting-edge treatments for many serious disorders, the stigma surrounding mental illness in our culture, systemic inequality in mental health treatment, and the mental health challenges of today.#talkmentalillness curates the interviews from the Mental Health Experts series into an accessible learning experience that will help you have conversations about mental health. Talking about mental illness is both the content and desired outcome of this course, as you will use what you learn from my interviews with mental health experts to guide your own discussions about mental health challenges and treatments with family members, friends, colleagues, and other people in your life. The course will begin by presenting a core set of definitions for mental illness and analyzing the stigma associated with it. We will then apply these topics to specific psychological disorders, including anxiety and mood disorders, eating disorders, suicide, substance use, and psychosis. We will then consider how these issues disproportionately impact marginalized groups and communities of color. The course will conclude by considering innovative approaches to psychological treatments and how the pursuit and science of happiness inform mental health and wellness.\\n \\nThis course is part of a broader educational mission to share the science of mental illness with both students and the public, both locally and globally. I have designed and created it in collaboration with the Office for Academic Innovation and Librariesâ\\x80\\x99 Media Services Team at the University of Colorado Boulder.\\n\\n- June Gruber', '30 ratings', '6,533 recent views', '4,456 already enrolled'], ['(Business Writing) Ø§Ù\\x84Ù\\x83ØªØ§Ø¨Ø© Ù\\x81Ù\\x8a Ù\\x85Ø¬Ø§Ù\\x84 Ø§Ù\\x84Ø£Ø¹Ù\\x85Ø§Ù\\x84 | Coursera', 'Course', 'https://www.coursera.org/learn/writing-for-business-ar', 'Ù\\x84Ø§ Ø´Ù\\x83 Ø£Ù\\x86 Ø¥ØªÙ\\x82Ø§Ù\\x86 Ø§Ù\\x84Ù\\x83ØªØ§Ø¨Ø© Ù\\x85Ù\\x86 Ø£Ù\\x87Ù\\x85 Ø§Ù\\x84Ù\\x85Ù\\x87Ø§Ø±Ø§Øª Ø§Ù\\x84ØªÙ\\x8a Ù\\x8aÙ\\x85Ù\\x83Ù\\x86Ù\\x83 ØªØ¹Ù\\x84Ù\\x85Ù\\x87Ø§ Ø¨Ù\\x8fØºÙ\\x8aØ© ØªØ\\xadÙ\\x82Ù\\x8aÙ\\x82 Ø§Ù\\x84Ù\\x86Ø¬Ø§Ø\\xad Ù\\x81Ù\\x8a Ù\\x85Ø¬Ø§Ù\\x84 Ø§Ù\\x84Ø£Ø¹Ù\\x85Ø§Ù\\x84.

It is now being offered globally as one of Peking Universityâ\\x80\\x99s MOOCs. \\n\\nAddressing students' interests in 20th century Western Music Culture and incorporating music theory, the course examines 20th century Western music. By combining theory and practice, the course not only aims to provide a clear view of the historical development of the music, but also emphasizes the training of aural skills and the accumulation of musical knowledge. The course covers not only classical music, such as neo-classical, expressionism, nationalism and other genres, but also explores in depth jazz, rock, and pop music of the 20th century. While studying Chinese music and other forms of national folk music in the 20th century world music context, students will also analyze large and complex works such as opera, musicals, and film music. By enhancing studentsâ\\x80\\x99 understanding of 20th century Western music (classical music, pop music, folk music, comprehensive art) as a foundation, three core questions will be addressed: what is music, what is the 20th century Western music, and what is effective listening? The course aims to guide students to examine the three listening modes of 20th century Western music with the hope of forming a diverse and multi-faceted, knowledge and understanding of the 20th-century Western music culture phenomena, expanding studentsâ\\x80\\x99 horizons, enhancing their ability to reason by analogy, and promoting cross-disciplinary, creative development.\", '43 ratings', '2,287 recent views', '4,095 already enrolled'], ['21st Century Energy Transition: how do we make it work? | Coursera', 'Course', 'https://www.coursera.org/learn/21st-century-energy-transition', 'Affordable, abundant and reliable energy is fundamental to human well-being and prosperity.

We start by first building a comprehensive geometric model of a camera and then develop a method for finding (calibrating) the internal and external parameters of the camera model. Then, we show how two such calibrated cameras, whose relative positions and orientations are known, can be used to recover the 3D structure of the scene. This is what we refer to as simple binocular stereo. Next, we tackle the problem of uncalibrated stereo where the relative positions and orientations of the two cameras are unknown. Interestingly, just from the two images taken by the cameras, we can both determine the relative positions and orientations of the cameras and then use this information to estimate the 3D structure of the scene. Next, we focus on the problem of dynamic scenes. Given two images of a scene that includes moving objects, we show how the motion of each point in the image can be computed. This apparent motion of points in the image is called optical flow. Optical flow estimation allows us to track scene points over a video sequence. Next, we consider the video of a scene shot using a moving camera, where the motion of the camera is unknown. We present structure from motion that takes as input tracked features in such a video and determines not only the 3D structure of the scene but also how the camera moves with respect to the scene. The methods we develop in the course are widely used in object modeling, 3D site modeling, robotics, autonomous navigation, virtual reality and augmented reality.', '15 ratings', '4,155 recent views', '1,525 already enrolled'], ['3D Reconstruction - Single Viewpoint  | Coursera', 'Course', 'https://www.coursera.org/learn/3d-reconstruction---single-viewpoint', 'This course focuses on the recovery of the 3D structure of a scene from its 2D images. In particular, we are interested in the 3D reconstruction of a rigid scene from images taken by a stationary camera (same viewpoint). This problem is interesting as we want the multiple images of the scene to capture complementary information despite the fact that the scene is rigid and the camera is fixed. To this end, we explore several ways of capturing images where each image provides additional information about the scene.In order to estimate scene properties (depth, surface orientation, material properties, etc.) we first define several important radiometric concepts, such as, light source intensity, surface illumination, surface brightness, image brightness and surface reflectance. Then, we tackle the challenging problem of shape from shading - recovering the shape of a surface from its shading in a single image. Next, we show that if multiple images of a scene of known reflectance are taken while changing the illumination direction, the surface normal at each scene point can be computed. This method, called photometric stereo, provides a dense surface normal map that can be integrated to obtain surface shape. \\n\\nNext, we discuss depth from defocus, which uses the limited depth of field of the camera to estimate scene structure. From a small number of images taken by changing the focus setting of the lens, a dense depth of the scene is recovered. Finally, we present a suite of techniques that use active illumination (the projection of light patterns onto the scene) to get precise 3D reconstructions of the scene. These active illumination methods are the workhorse of factory automation. They are used on manufacturing lines to assemble products and inspect their visual quality. They are also extensively used in other domains such as driverless cars, robotics, surveillance, medical imaging and special effects in movies.', '11 ratings', '4,515 recent views', '1,703 already enrolled'], ['3D SARS-CoV-19 Protein Visualization With Biopython', 'Course', 'https://www.coursera.org/learn/3d-sars-cov-19-protein-visualization-with-biopython', None, None, None, '1,501 already enrolled'], ['3D, perspective text effect on Photoshop', 'Course', 'https://www.coursera.org/learn/3d-perspective-text-effect-on-photoshop', None, None, None, None], ['4 In A Row Game Development with Google Cloud + Unity', 'Course', 'https://www.coursera.org/learn/googlecloud-4-in-a-row-game-development-with-google-cloud-unity-hfcwa', 'We help millions of organizations empower their employees, serve their customers, and build whatâ\\x80\\x99s next for their businesses with innovative technology created inâ\\x80\\x94and forâ\\x80\\x94the cloud.

Economic development is deeply coupled with the use of metals. During the 20th century, the variety of metal applications in society grew rapidly. In addition to mass applications such as steel in buildings and aluminium in planes, more and more different metals are in use for innovative technologies such as the use of the speciality metal indium in LCD screens.  A lot of metals will be needed in the future. It will not be easy to provide them. In particular in emerging economies, but also in industrialised countries, the demand for metals is increasing rapidly. Mining and production activities expand, and with that also the environmental consequences of metal production.  \\n\\nIn this course, we will explore those consequences and we will also explore options to move towards a more sustainable system of metals production and use. We will focus especially on the options to reach a circular economy for metals: keeping metals in use for a very long time, to avoid having to mine new ones.  \\n\\nThis course is based on the reports of the Global Metals Flows Group of the International Resource Panel that is part of UN Environment.  An important aspect that will come back each week, are the UN Sustainable Development Goals, the SDGs. Those are ambitious goals to measure our progress towards a more sustainable world.

Along the way, we encounter Perpetua and her martyrdom in Carthage; the struggles of Augustine the bishop in North Africa; the zeal of Celtic monks and missionaries; the viciousness of the Crusades; the visions of Brigit of Sweden; and the fracturing of Christianity by Martin Lutherâ\\x80\\x99s protest. We hear the voices of great theologians as well as of those branded heretics by the Church, a powerful reminder that the growth of Christianity is a story with many narratives of competing visions of reform and ideals, powerful critiques of corruption and venality, and exclusion of the vanquished.  The troubled history of Christian engagement with Jews and Muslims is found in pogroms and expulsions, but also in the astonishing ways in which the culture of the West was transformed by Jewish and Islamic learning.We shall explore the stunning beauty of the Book of Kells, exquisitely prepared by monks as the Vikings terrorized the coast of England. We will experience the blue light of the windows of Chartres, and ponder the opening questions of Thomas Aquinasâ\\x80\\x99 great Summa. We will read from the Gutenberg Bible of the fifteenth century, which heralded the revolution brought by the printing press. We will travel from Calvinâ\\x80\\x99s Geneva to Elizabethâ\\x80\\x99s England to Trent, where a Catholic Council met to inaugurate a modern, missionary Catholic church. We will walk through the great Escorial of Philip II of Spain, hear the poetry of John of the Cross, and follow the Jesuits to Brazil and China.\\n \\nChristianity in the West was forged in the fires of conflict and tumult, and it brought forth both creativity and violence.

Ã\\x89 preciso conhecimento, dedicaÃ§Ã£o e criatividade para produzir mÃºsica.\\n    \\nFornecer conhecimento Ã© o propÃ³sito deste curso. NÃ£o importa o tipo de mÃºsica que vocÃª estÃ¡ produzindo, hÃ¡ um grande conjunto de ferramentas que vocÃª precisarÃ¡ usar.  Cada liÃ§Ã£o deste curso demonstrarÃ¡ um conjunto diferente de ferramentas de produÃ§Ã£o musical, seguindo vagamente o processo da produÃ§Ã£o musical de gravar, editar e mixar. \\n\\nVamos comeÃ§ar com algumas noÃ§Ãµes sobre a natureza do som e como o percebemos. Em seguida, vamos analisar os componentes necessÃ¡rios para gravar Ã¡udio em um computador, para que vocÃª compreenda os dispositivos pelos quais o som precisa se deslocar em um processo de produÃ§Ã£o musical. \\n    \\nDepois de gravado, o som precisa ser organizado em uma linha de tempo, um processo conhecido como ediÃ§Ã£o. A ediÃ§Ã£o nos permite dar a impressÃ£o de execuÃ§Ãµes perfeitas e criar muitos dos sons que ouvimos na mÃºsica contemporÃ¢nea. A ferramenta de ediÃ§Ã£o contemporÃ¢nea Ã© a estaÃ§Ã£o de trabalho de Ã¡udio digital (DAW, Digital Audio Workstation), um software que armazena e organiza todos os recursos de um projeto musical. Vamos focar as ferramentas de ediÃ§Ã£o que sÃ£o essenciais na produÃ§Ã£o de mÃºsica contemporÃ¢nea e que sÃ£o fornecidas por todas as DAWs. \\n\\nApÃ³s a ediÃ§Ã£o, os sons devem ser combinados ou mixados, por isso vamos analisar a mesa de mixagem, que pode ser um local muito criativo se vocÃª souber usÃ¡-la. Vamos explorar as funcionalidades bÃ¡sicas das mesas de mixagem em hardware e software, inclusive volume, panning, mudo, solo, barramentos, inserÃ§Ãµes, envios e submixagens. O processo de mixagem, no entanto, engloba mais ferramentas do que a mesa de mixagem fornece. O som tambÃ©m deve ser processado, ou seja, modificado de modo a fazer com que seu estado gravado se enquadre no contexto da mÃºsica. Vamos analisar a compressÃ£o, a equalizaÃ§Ã£o e o retardo, alÃ©m de examinar os muitos efeitos de Ã¡udio que sÃ£o extensÃµes desses dispositivos e como eles sÃ£o usados em um contexto musical.\\n    \\nNo fim das contas, o processo de produÃ§Ã£o musical depende da sua criatividade. A criatividade Ã© um produto da mente, e ela permanece armazenada ali, sem ser expressada, atÃ© que as ferramentas certas sÃ£o usadas da maneira certa para compartilhÃ¡-la com o mundo. Se vocÃª tem uma ideia em mente, precisarÃ¡ passar por inÃºmeras etapas, cada uma com uma ferramenta importante, para chegar ao seu pÃºblico. Traga a dedicaÃ§Ã£o e criatividade para este curso, que ele fornecerÃ¡ o conhecimento para fazer acontecer.', '34 ratings', '4,719 recent views', '3,117 already enrolled'], ['ADHD: Everyday Strategies for Elementary Students | Coursera', 'Course', 'https://www.coursera.org/learn/adhd-treatment', 'This course will provide an overview of ADHD diagnosis and treatment.
